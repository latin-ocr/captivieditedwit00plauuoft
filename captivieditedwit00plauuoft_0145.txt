...Et te et hunc amittam hinc, Mil. 1213 diuitias dabo, si impetras. The
freedom that Plautus allowed himself with Conditional sentences may be
seen from a comparison of Pers. 827 malum <390 uobis dabo, πί abins,
Mil. 450 nisi uoluntate ibis, rapiam te domum, and Bacch. 1172 m' αὖρα-3,...

malum tibi maynum dabo iam.
7. Huic, i.e. who lives in the house beside which Ι am standing (see

note on v. 38).

8. Alterum. The compounds altrinsecus, altrovorsum are not sufficient
evidence for a pronunciation of the simple Pronoun with -tr- instead of -ter-,
so that I doubt the change in this verse of alterum to altrum and in Pers.
226 of altera to altra. The clash of metrical ictus (alterum) with word-
accent (alterum) in a word of this form is tolerated by Plautus in the first
foot of the line or hemistich (eg. v. 833 3 see Introd. iii. ξ 9). Similarly at
the beginning of Most. 630 quattzior need not be changed to the Vulg. Lat.
form quattor (Introd. ii. ξ 15). Cf. Naev. Com. 23 sq. R. Alterc's inanem
waluulam madidcim dari, Alte'ris nuces z'n procliui prosz-ndere. Surrupuit‚
pronounced as a trisyllable here and in two other passages of this play
(vv. 760, 1011). Since the contracted pronunciation (of. Hor. O. iv. 13. 20
surpuerat& Lucr. ii. 314 surpere Inf.) is restricted to these three instances,
all of them at the end of the line, it was clearly not favoured by Plautus,
and was adopted only through metrical exigencies. There is no authority
for a shortened form of any other part of the verb in Plautus. We should
scan Pers. 150 zznd(e) surrzipta sit, Poen. 902 737zd(e) surrzipcus (see Introd.
ii. ξ 14), l’ocn. 1050 Surreiptus sum.

9. Profugiens (cf. note on v, 18). Vendidit (Introd. ii. ξ l).
Alide. The un-Attic form of the name, with A„ not E„ is used by
Plautus, with the result that A lei, Aleos, &c are again and again confused
with alii, alios in our MSS. (sec note on v, 24).

10. Huiusce. This form is not found in Plautus, except at Poen. 1257
Huiusce fratm'sfilz'us, and is rejected by most editors as un-Plautine. It is
however used by Terence (Andr. 439, Plcorm. 827, where it stands before
an initia] vowel). Perhaps hominis, written lacis, may have been dropped
out here and elsewhere (eg. Poen. prol. 83) from our MSS. after the Gen.
of the Pronoun (old spelling koius ; as in A at Pseud. 271). Schoell reads
