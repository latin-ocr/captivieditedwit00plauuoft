9. In the treatment of Anapaests, Dactyls (and Proceleusmatics)
care is taken by the Latin Dramatists (as by their Greek models)
that these feet shall not be markedly out of proportion to the
Iambus which they represent. Where one short syllable was the
final of one word and the other short syllable the initial of a follow—
ing word, the pause inevitable between the words added to the time
of such an Anapaest or Dactyl, and made them unsuitable for use
in Iambic (or Trochaic)1 verse. So While Tribrachs are freely divided
between words, an Anapaest of this form υ, υ ss, and a Dactyl of
this form Δ υ, υ are not fawoured, unless the two words are closely
joined in pronunciation‚ like propter-amorem (see Appendix) in Mil.
1284:

alium alio pacto propter amorem ni sciam.

To express the rule differently, the two syllables of a resolved thesis in
lambio (or Trochaic) Verse should not belong to separate words. Since the
thesis of Iambic or Trochaic metre is properly a short syllable, the resolution
of the thesis is really the substitution of two short syllables for one, and is
itself ‘irrationaL’ But its ‘iirational’ character would be unduly increased by
the pause that inevitably attends upon the conclusion of a word.

In the first foot of the line, however, Plautus freely allows such
an Anapaest (in Trochaic Verse, a Dactyl, ἓ 16), eg. Mil. 28:

At indiligenter icerain. Pol si quidem, δια,

and indeed a small, subordinate word like at would be in pro-
nunciation joined with the longer neighbouring word (see Ap-
pendix), so that a division like dc indiliyenter would hardly be
avoided at any part of the line.

Klotz, Grnndzime p. 304, is wrong in denying that the first foot of the line
or hemistich was disserent from the others in respect of word-division (see
Seyffert in Berl. Phil. ll'och. 1891, p. 925). In the New Comedy, where the
admission of trisyllabic feet into the Iambic Trimeter most nearly approaches
the Latin usage, those feet are not divided between words, unless the words are
closely connected. This division is found especially in the first foot (for details
see Persehinka in Dissert. I’Izilol. Vindob. iii.).

The division of a rcsolved arsis is not open to the same ‘a priori‘ objec-
tions as tho division of a resolved thosis, since the arsis in Iambic and Trochaic
verse is a long syllable and is the metrical equivalent of two short syllables.
still, it is truc that an Anapaest of this form ...sq v—, and a Dactyl of this form
-ύ, v... is not quito the same as a trochee or au iambus. Even though it is
the (long) arsis and not the (properly short) thesis that is resolved, the division
