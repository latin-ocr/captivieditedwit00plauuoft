150. Of. Cas. 262:

A. Quia enim filio

Nos oportet opitulari unico. B. At quamquam unicust,

Nilo magis ille unicust mihi (unicus est ille milei MSS.) filius quam

ego illi pater.

Also Bacch. 407. Mi. In the MSS. mihi seems to be written when
the scribe realized that the Dat. Sg. of the Pronoun was meant, mi being
reserved for the Voc. Sg. of the Possessive, eg. mz‘ pater. We need not
therefore have scruples in changing mila· of the MSS. to mi or ‘vice versa.⁷
In this line there is something to be said for the retention of the form
mihi, and the avoidance of the absorption by elision of a word, whose
contrast to tibi would bring it a certain amount of stress. This would
however involve an abnormal division of a proceleusmatic between words
ulnz‘czist milei eltiam (888 Introd. iii. ξ 9), unless we are to admit the by-
form uncus (see note on v. 321), like ardus, a by-form of aridus. Unico
magis unicus. Uist. 644 0 Salute mea salus salubrior, Curc. 551 stultior
stulto suisti.

151. Cum...ducis, a very frequent construction after verbs of praising
and thanking (cf. vv. 356, 373, 922). So in Cic. Fam. xiii. 24. 2 tibi
maximas qratia-s· ayo, cum tantum litterae meae potuerunt, although quod
is the real equivalent in Cicero to Plautine quom in this use. Malum
cum. In pronunciation the accent would probably fall 011 1118 second
syllable of malum (see note on v. 18). Amici and tuum, the emphatic
words, have the metrical ictus. Ducis, without esse, as in Mero. 322
at ηε deteriorem tamen Hoc facto duem, διο.

152 sqq. I follow the usual distribution of the lines in recent editions.
Lambinus, who corrected most of the mistakes in the ‘ notae personarum'
of the MSS. in this passage, may have used the famous ‘codex Turnebi'
(Introd. i. ξ 2).

152. Habe bonum animum. This is the usual form of the phrase
(a phrase not found in Terence, who uses only bono (mimo es), Ιιάόἔ bonum
dm‘mum, while lacibe animam bonum (sometimes lnmum dnimum habe) is
admitted through mctrical cxigcncies at the end of a line &c In v. 167,
as in Pseud. 866, we have hab& 71ιόάο bonum (inimum; in Mil. 1011 and
