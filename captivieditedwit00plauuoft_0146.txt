120 PLAVTI CAPTIVL [1 1—13

Negat hercle illic ultimus. Accedito.
Si non ubi sedeas locus est, est ubi ambules,
Quando histrionem cogis mendicarier.

patri huius: cette (Plur. of cedo, ‘tell me²). If this prologue be of late
composition, there is also the possibility of a pseudo—archaism huiusce (4
syll.), like anticuum (4 syll.) in the prologue (V. 5) of the Casina (quoted on
p. 113), or even of Hiatus (cf. Aul. prol. 5 patri Ι auoque). It may be
remarked that the same question arises about a line (v. 83) of the prologue
of the Poenulus : Sed illi patruo huius qui uiuit senex, where some editors
would substitute huiusce. Tenetis. Teneo, ‘I understand ' (Gk. ἔχω),
16 common in colloquial Latin (with iam as here, Epz‘d. 401 iam tems ?,
Trz'u. 780 temes iamss). 11 occurs with some equivalents in Pers. 333 scis?
tenes? intelleyz's? (cf. v. 697 below), and is occasion of a pun in Cure. 44
A. Recte tenes. B. Jlliuusformidabo, ue excidat, and Poen. 565. Optu-
mest, κάλλιστα ἔχει, ‘very good,' the superlative of bene est (eg. V. 699 3
cf. pessumest Amph. 314), has been wrongly expanded in our MSS. to
optumum est, τὸ ἄριστόν ἐστι, ‘it is the best plan' (eg. v. 557 concedi
optumumst). The same corruption is found in the ‘Palatine’ MSS. at
Stich. 537 (cf. Stich. 120 minimum cst for minimest), and in A at Bacch. 502.

11. Τ116 reading of the MSS. is quite satisfactory, with the single
exception that the archaic Nom. Sing. mxc (ille with the Particle -ce
affixed) has been modernized in the usual fashion. If we restore illic
(cf. ad V. 39) the line becomes metrical; for ultimus is a legitimate case
of ‘syllaba anceps' at a pause in the line (cf. Introd. ii. ξ 33). Accedito,
‘let him come forward' (hardly 2 Sg.; see note on v. 114), should not be
changed to abscedico (Rost). The speaker requires the disturber at the
back of the theatre to come forward towards the stage, and, when the
order has been obeyed, addresses him in the terms of vv, 12-14, then
resumes (111 v. 15) 1116 narrative to the audience. Schoell's hypothesis of
an omission after ultimus (666 11016 011 arg. 1) is unnecessary.

12. ‘ If there is no sitting-mom inside, there is walking-room outside.’
Vbi sedeas locus. The Relative clause which defines a Noun often
precedes it; cf. Aul. 673 Nuuc hoc ubi abstrudam coqqz'to solum locum,
liud. 111 [An] quo furatum mox uenias uestz'yas loca& Most. 969 quo
ucucm'm noui locum, Most. 244 Quae pro me causam diceret, patronum
liberam. Est ubi ambules clearly intimates expulsion from the
theatro. To find in the words a permission to walk about in the passage
in front of the stage is absurd.

13. Equally absurd, as it seems to me, is the explanation of this line
