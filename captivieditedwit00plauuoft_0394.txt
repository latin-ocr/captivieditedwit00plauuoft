the accentuation of every-day life, eg.

Capt. 837 Cedo manum. lisanum? Manum, inquam, &o
Most. 595 Non dat, non debet. Non debat ?, &c
Prin, 94o—1
Ad caput amnis, quod de caelo exoritur sub solio Iouis.
S1‘1b solio Iouis? Ita dico, &c.

Similarly in shouting, eg.
Men. 432 Eho, Messenio! accede huc ἰ, &c.‚

and in the exclamation (usually) ei mikz‘ (for details see Richter in Stude-
mund's Studien i. p. 470).

8. The other class of words which accented the final syllable consists
of those which have contracted their two last syllables into one, eg. nostras
from nostratis (the Plautine form), abit from abivit. These contracted
Perfects take normally the ictus on their final syllable in Plautus and
Terence.

9. Of trisyllables, we have seen that tribrach-words (like tribrach
word—endings) are never used with an ictus on their second syllable, e.g.
yene‘ra, while dactyl-words are occasionally allowed with this incidence
of ictus by Plautus (not by Terence) in the first foot of an iambic line or
hemistich, eg. pect6ra. Molossus-words are not infrequent with ictus on
the first syllable when their final syllable is elided, e. g. Ter. Andr. init. :

poeta cumprimfflm) animuum) ad scrsbend(um) appulit,

this discrepancy of ictus and accent being regarded as less unpleasant than
a double discrepancy like scribendam. Cf. Intr. iii. ξ 7 on the tolerance of
‘com77zut(67n)' &o (as opposed to ‘commutem' unelided) in the ‘even' feet
of Iambic and the ‘odd' feet of Trochaic lines (Introd. iii. ξ 7).

Bentley's (and Hermann’s) theory that in reading Latin poetry the accent
was shifted a syllable nearer the beginning of a word, whose last syllable was
elided, would produce in this line of Terence an exact correspondence of accent
and ictus3 for cumprimum would become by the elision of the final czimprimfflm),
and scribendum would be pronounced scribendwm) fron] the sanie cause. But
the theory lacks confirmation and seems on the face of it to be very unlikely to
meet with any. (On Klotz’s equally unsuccessful attempt to explain in this
way scansions like pra‘fectw), see Intr. ii. ξ 29.)

The reason for Plautus' toleration of the ictus pectdra but not of ῃεηὲνα may
have been that a word like glenera could easily occupy some other part of the
line, whereas, since an anapaesta of the form vv, —‚ eg. pec-liora surlyunt, is not
legitimate in iambic verse, dactyl-words would find greater difficulty in gaining
admission. The ictus is readily tolerated οι] the final syllable of a tribrach (aud
dactylic) word. The question however of the incidence of ictus (and accent) on final
syllables rather belongs to the subject of enclitics and to Sentence-accentuation.

10. Of quadrisyllables, words of the form *mr-1, eg. balineae, which,
as we have seen, retained in Plautus' time their early accentuation of the
first syllable, have the ictus also on this first syllable as a rule in the verses
