121. ‘ If my hands are empty (quod clem, sc. money for manumission ;
cf. Tm‘n. 564), shall 1 take to my heels‘Z' (Cf. Comedy of Errors Ι. ii. ‘Hold
your hands ! Nay, an you will not, sir, I’ll take to my heels') There is
some reason for accepting Schrader's emendation men πίε dem ipsus, for
in the first place the interrogative particle commonly appears as -π after
along vowel (eg. quin for qui-ne), and in the second ipsus is the normal
form in conjunction with se, suus, and the like. The change of ipsus into
ipse, and the substitution of the full for the eurtailed form of the particle,
are too common in MSS. to cause us any great scruples in altering their
reading in this line. Still we have elsewhere the full form of the Inter-
rogative Particle in our MSS. after an emphatic monosyllable, eg. Ter.

get his assistant-s to come and help him to carry out Hegio’s orders
(vv, Ill-2).

126. Hegio's dealings in Elean prisoners of war (vv. 98—100) have
been so extensive that his own ‘ergastulum' is not large enough, and he
has had to avail himself of his lnwther's too. He does not carry out his
intention (vv. 192 sqq.) of going to his brothers house till after Aet 11.
