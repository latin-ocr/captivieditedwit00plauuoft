24 INTRODUCTION.

¹pronunciation is observed. The coin called after King Philip of
Macedon is always scanned as a tribrach, Philippus (Gk. Φίλιππος),
in Plautus, just as we tolerate a mispronunciation of the word
‘three' in ‘threepence,' which is not tolerated in other combinations,
e.g. ‘three days‚' ‘three pounds.' But the name Philippus, when
used as the name of a person and not as the name of a coin, has the
‘ literary’ pronunciation (υ - υ)1. Beside bracchium Plautus admits
Acchemms, and apparently AcchiHes, eg. [llere. 488:

Acchillem orabo, aurum ut mihi det Hector qui expensus

fuit.

AcchilLes may be the form exclusively used. (For details see Baier in
Philoloyische Abhandlungyen zu Hertz, 1888.) The scansion Acherunsia, Acheron-
tem seems to be found in Ennius Τναῃ. 70, 203 R. (cf. Acheruntis? Inc. Trag. 77
R„ but Acherunte ibid. 73) ε 1116 first syllable is always long in Plautus. Perhaps
mace-haara (Pseud. 593) is the Plautina form (see Harv. Scud. ix. 126); but
cf. Enn. Α. 535.

But in words which had not so definitely been absorbed in the
Roman language the correct quantity is observed, eg. in personal
names like Eutychus, Philolaches.

Another familiar Greek word of the same form as Φίλιππος was τάλαντον, Lat.
talentum. The scansion talentum is required by the reading of the MSS. (P) in
Mil. 1061 (anapaestic metre) :

Dabitur quantum ipsus preti poscet. Talentum Philippi huic opus a1'1ri est,

but in all other passages the second syllable of the word is long. On the loan-
words sagitta, satelles and. on perinde, see below, ξ 23.

The insertion of a parasitis: vowel in those loan-words from the Greek which
contained an un-Roman combination of consonants, eg. mina (μνᾶ), drachuma
(δραχμή), Alcumena (Ἀλκμήνη), may be mentioned under this head. Accius seems
1ο have been the first 10 insist on the more exact reproduction of Greek names.
(For details see Ritschl, Opuwula, ii. pp. 469 sqq.)

12. Prodelision of ‘esst ‘est‚’ like our ‘it’s' for ‘it is‚' ‘he's'
for ‘he is‚' Sic. Every page of Plautus offers forms like facturu's
(with last syllable scanned long) for facturus es (ess), fizcturusc for

facturus est, facturumst for fiio-turum est, ἀεὶ, (icc. These forms‚‘or
some of them, were current in poetry and prose of a later time also.

Leo doubts the conti-action after any long syllable, eg. rest (Cas. 578, Pers. 223)
for νῖιε est, Amentitnzdoni(lest Pers. 120 for -dcs est, sospest for sospes (-ess) est. (For
details see Leo, Flaui. Forsch. 255.) Skutsch Joubts it after —ss for -ts‚ ἄτα, e.g.
‘sos-pens but allows rest (Jahresher. Roman. Philol. iv. 81). These formsfacturust‚
dc, some refer neither to ‘prodelision of e of (κη-ε’ (the Roman Grammarians'
explanation) nor to elision of final s before the initial vowel (Leo's theory), but to

¹ Even in Pers. 339, if reglis Philippi may be supposed 10 form a word—group
(cf. rea: Creo &o- always in this order and never separated by an intervening
word) τ Mirilm quin reglis-Philippi causa aut Attali (cf. iii. ἓ 7).
