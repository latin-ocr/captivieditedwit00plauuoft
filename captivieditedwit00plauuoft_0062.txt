40 INTRODUCTION.

Anapaestic metre a collocation like ,νεῖ 15 not favoured (iii. § 21), and Bacchiae
and Cretic hardly allow the operation of the Breves Breviantes Law (ἕ 342).

The scarcity of clear instances of the ictus ubi dcc. may be accounted for by the ·

nature of the metres of Plautus, and is also, no doubt, a consequence of the close
correspondence of ictus and accent in his verses. Adhuc (accented on the final)
is never under any circumstances a pyrrich.

(On the short scansion of -ᾰε, -is before a consonant, even when the
ictus falls on these syllableS‚ eg. satzss‘ male accipiar, see g 3 3 and on
the mistaken theory of Φ ubi as necessarily ubi and not ubi &c.‚ see

iii. g 9.)

29²². It is not true that this shortening is forbidden in the 2οᾶ 01 4th syllable
of a proceleusmatic which has the ictus on the first syllable. We have, for
example, tib? in the proceleusmatic tibi plact- Mero. 965: Uxor tibi placida
et placatast. Ce‘tte deaetras minctum. (The other examples, which are not many,
are collected by Skutsch in Sutura V iadrina.) Even two shortenings in
the same proceleusmatic (with ictus 011 11151Ιο1 third syllable) seem to be
tolerated, eg. 3915 quidem in Epid. 202: A. Et ego Apoecides 511111. Β. Et
ego quidem 51110 Ερ1ε110115. Sed, 010, optuma; dar} potest in Mero. 778: A. Dari
potest interea dum illi ponunt. Β. Quin abis (ΑΡ). (Cf. Cure. 311, Asin. 147,
dcc. ‘Wait a bit’ was in Latin φηιῐηέ mane, e.g. Aul. 655; see App. ξ 9.) The
shortening is also tolerated in a dactyl which forms the fourth foot of a
Trochaic Septenarius (iii. ἕ 17), e.g. 110τέ)· in Trin. 316: Neu tibi aegritudinem,
pater, parerem parsi sedulo; ub7 in Capt. 559: Credidi esse insanum extemplo
ubi te appellauit Tyndarum; 1⁰⁷1¹ Ιιὸσ in Pers. 37: Quos continuo tibi reponam
in hoc triduo aut quadriduo. (For other examples 500 Skutsch in Satura
Viadrina.)

It is not true to say (with Klotz, erzdzz'iye, p. 56) that this shortening is
avoided in the even feet of Iambic, and the odd feet of Trochaic lines. We have
numerous instances to the contrary, eg. (101οῑ 111 Capt. 21: Hic nunc domi
seruit 5110 patri nec scit pater3 abi in Gapt. 870: A. Nunc tu mihi places,
B. Abi, stultu's, 5010 post tenipus uenis. (For other examples 500 Podiaski,
Troch. Sept. Ter. p. 22; Menning in Ham-ard Studies, ix.) But it seems to be
avoided in the thesis of the seventh foot of an Iambic 801113011011115ἱ (and Octo-
narius).

Klotz's theory (Grundziiye, p. 82) that retrogression of the accent following
011 0115100, e.g. vitiles-Mae), (imicfiz), legitimizes a scansion like molest(ae) hae
sum (as he proposes to read for molestae-sunt in Mil. 69), amic-(a.) uter ‘utmbi &c-
(ξ 17),“15 most unlikely. We have no reason for thinking that when any final
syllable whatever was elided the accent went a syllable nearer the beginning of
the word (see Appendix), but only when an enclitic appendix like -que was

elided, eg. p⁷‘‹5spereq(ue) (ξ 28). So plerique, but the word-group pleriqwe)
-o'mnes (Amer. Journ. Phil. xiv. 169).

1 Terence’s Septenarius-endings: quin 0ρὸ maneo Haut. 737, tuom tibi reddo
Haut. 742, et mihi pras-it Hec. 798 are not exceptions, for tibi, mihi, as well
as eqo, were by his time rather pyri-ich than iambic words. Poen. 1198 inqe‘nium
patris habet qadd sapit, a Dimetcr, shews this shortening.
