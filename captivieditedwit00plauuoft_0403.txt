APPENDIX. 373

where in speaking one would naturally accentuate the first syllable of all
four words, mam, e'yo, τά, me'am, but where the adaptation of the metrical
ictus to each of these would have a monotonous effect. Sometimes it is
departed from through metrical necessity, ag. Trin. 65:

edepol proinde 111 diu uiuitur, bene uiuitur,

‘the Zonyer we live, the better we live‚' where the prosodical nature of the
words diu and bene made it difficult to bring them into the Arses of the
line. Terence gets over this difficulty in Eun. prol. 8 by adopting the
unusual scansion bonis (Intr. 11. ξ 17);

ex Graecis bdm‘s Latinas fecit non bonas.

(Of. Poen. 853 moretm, emphatic.) We must never forget that the metre
of Plautus is quantitative metre, not accentual metre like ours, and that
all that can be posited for his verse is a regard for accent as far as this is
consistent with quantitative requirements. We cannot in all cases look
for an invariable adherence to an incidence of ictus which will conform
with the accent, but only to a normal adherence. Metrical exigencies and
a variety of other causes must again and again have intervened to make
close adherence impossible, even if desirable, just as metrical exigencies
have often necessitated departure from the regular order of words in a
phrase or sentence. Even in our own accentual verse the word or syllable
which receives the stress of the voice in pronunciation does not always
receive the beat of the verse, which often falls on a quite unstressed and
subordinate word. Much more is this conflict of accent with ictus to be
expected in the lines of the Latin Drama, which are quantitative lines and
not accentual.

25. We have hitherto considered the regard for accent shewn in the
dialogue metres (Iambic and T rochaic) of the Dramatists. In the chorio
metres, Bacchiac, Cretic, Anapaestic, &c.‚ we should be prepared to find a
different state of things, for the passages composed in these metres were
not spoken but sung, and do not, like the dialogue passages, aim at a close
reproduction of the tone and diction of ordinary conversation. The Cretic
and Bacchiae metms, with their abundance of long syllables, especially
favour forms like mihi, modo (Ιιύο uolo scire ιὲ Curc. 134), which were not
the forms employed in common speech3 and in Cantica in these and other
metres we often find departures from the normal order of words in current
phrases and from the normal incidence of ictus as well. Yet on the whole
we find the accentuation of the Paenultima Law and the Sentence-
Accentuation very fairly conscrved in these Cantica; and we have already
noticed how the admission of a long syllable in the place of the short thesis
is regulated by regard to the accent of the word (Intr. iii. ἐξ 28, 36).

Τ110 Cantica of Plautus however that are composed in the Anapaestic
Metre seem often to trample rough-shod on the accentuation. Their
harshness in this respect has been already referred to the Greek 11110
of Diaeresis at each metrum, or even each single foot, and the attempts
