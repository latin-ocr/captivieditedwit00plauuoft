INTRODUCTION.

I. THE MANUSORIPTS OF PLAUTUS.

l. Our MSS. of Plautus belong to two families. Of one family

. the only representative is

(A) the Ambrosian Palimpsest‚ a MS. probably of the Irish
Monastery of Bobbio in N. Italy, now in the Ambrosian Library,
Milan (with shelf-mark G 82 supr). It is written in Capita] letters of
the fourth, possibly the third century, but its original writing was
effaced from its pages, and a new text, a portion of the Old Testament
(1 Kings—2 Chron.), was written upon them in the 7th or Sth century.
Though it contained originally all the twenty-one ‘Varronian' plays
of Plautus, the plays declared by Varro to be universally accepted
as genuine, many leaves have been lost, including the whole of the
Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia and Curculio, and nearly the whole
of the Captivi and V idularia. Of the leaves that remain many are
wholly or in great part undecipherable, and all have offered more or
less difficulty to collators. The best preserved plays are the Stichus,
Persa, Poenulus, Pseudolus and Trinummus. A full description of
the MS. and an apograph of its text will be found in Studemund‚
Codicis Rescripti Ambrosiam Apogsraphum, Berlin, 1889.

2. The other family, usually called the ‘Palatine' family,
includes a number of MSS. in minuscule script, all derived fron]
a lost archetype which we may designate PA :—

(¹1¹) the Codex Turnebi or Fragmenta Senonensia, a fragmentary

MS. (of the 9th οι· lOth century probably), which belonged to the ,

Benedictine Monastery of S. Oolombe at Sens in Central F rauce,
and was used by the F rench scholar Adrien Turnebe in the sixteenth
century. The MS. seems to have been destroyed shortly after
Turnebe’s use of it. Besides the few isolated readings which he
