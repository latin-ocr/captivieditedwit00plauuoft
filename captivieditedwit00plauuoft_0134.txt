108 PLAv'ri CAPTIVI.

Latinus (with Adjective suffix -ino- of Gk. κορακ-ῖνος ete.) is spelt LA'rm-.
That Plautus spelt mendicus (Adjective suffix -ico-) with the simple vowel
i and ira (root eis-) with the diphthong ei is seen from the remarks in
Rud. 1305 that mendicus has ‘one letter more' than medicus, and in
Truc. 262 that ciram ‘anger' becomes eram ‘mistress' by ‘taking away
a single letter-‚² The word captivus has the Adjective suffix -ivo- and
would be spelt with the simple vowel in Plautus' time.

The ‘tags' from which the Argument has been patched together are
easily recognized, eg. prol. 8 Alterum quadrimum puerum seruus surrupuit
Eumque...uenclidit, prol. 27 Coepit captivos commercari lzz'c Aleos, prol. 36
Quo pacto hic seruus suum erum ltine amittat domum: Itaque iuter se
coumutuut uestem ac nomina, v. 1011 seruus qui te huic hinc quadrimum
surrupuit, Vendidit...lllz·c indicium fecit.

Captust in pugna Hegionis filius,
Alium quadrimum fugiens seruus uendidit.

1. The interval deliberately left blank between pugna and Hegionis
in the two MSS. V and E (see Critical Notes) suggests that something
has been lost between these two words. Schoell supposes that a hole in
the page (of 21 lines> of a very early archetype (see Introd. i. ξ 3) left
this verse and V. 11 of the Prologue¹ defective. But since the verse reads
perfectly well as it stands, the Hiatus being, as we have seen, quite natural
111 an Acrostic Argument, and since no suitable ‘missing word’ has been
produced by any scholar, it is safer to ascribe the peculial· transcription
in the two less important MSS. to an accident of their original (as in
vv, 620, 663, 941, where see Critical Notes). A descending ‘flourish' of
the heading ARGVMENTVM may have encroached 011 the line.

2. Alium. The lizirsh scansion alterum of prol. 8 Alterum quadrimum

puerum seruus surpuit is avoided by the writer of the Argument. The
sanie use of alius for alter is found 111 the last line of this Argument and

1 Prol. 11 follows at an interval of 21 lines, one of which was occupied by
the Prologue-heading.
