164 PLAVTI OAPTIVI. [170

Prognatum genere summo et summis diuitiis: 170

 

 

170. diuieiis BD: diuitiis VEJ

 

 

Nam eccum hic captiuom adulescentem <alium> Aleum,

alium referring to his new purehase of yesterday (V. 111). Another
possibility is that adulescentem should be adulescentulum, for Diminutive
forms are often replaced by Simple forms in our MSS. (Thus in Ter.
Haut. 546 the Codex Bembinus substitutes adulescentis for adulescentuli.)
Eccum (eccam, eccos, eccas, ecca Ace. Pl. Neut.) is apparently composed of
ecce and Itum, an obsolete by-form of laune which lacked the particle -ce.
With ecce prefixed this particle was regarded as superfluous, just as
eccillum, eccistam are the invariable forms, never eccillunc, ecci-stunc. This
interjectional compound passed more and more into use as a Demonstrative
in Vulgar Latin, supplanting itte which became a mere Definite Article.
It is from this late Latin Pronoun that the Romance Demonstratives,
Fr. celui, celle, Ital. quello, δια, have sprung. The Italian InterJ'ection ecco
is a direct descendant of eccum, which is often used absolutely, eg. Mil. 25
A. Ubi tu es? B. Eccum, or followed by an Accusative, e.g. Mil. 1216 era,
eccum praesto militem. Sometimes video or a similar verb aecompanies
eccum, eg. Men. 705 sed eccum uideo. In the Dramatists ecce in conjunction
with a Pronoun (ecce me, eccum, διο.) takes the place of ecce when a person
or thing that is in sight or in the neighbourhood is referred to, the simple
form ecce being used only in calling attention to actions, e.g. Mil. 456 ecce,
omitte, and with Abstract Nouns, ἕω, eg. Rud. 1178 ecce Gripi scelera.
The subject of the sentence is usually attracted into the Ace. by eccum, &c.‚
eg. Amph. 1005 sed eccum Amphitruonem aduenit, except when the verb
precedes, eg. Pseud. 693 uenit eccum Calidorus.

170. Cf. vv. 318—9. Prognatum genere summo. Epid. 107
Idne pudet te quia captiuam yencre proynatam bono In praeda es mercatus ?,
Aut. 212 Α. Dz'c milti, quali me arbitrare genere proynatum? B. Bono,
Poen. 1201 Non co yeozere sumus proynatae, tam etsi sumus seruae, soror, Ut
deceat nos facere quicquam quod homo quisquam inrideat. The alliterative
proynatus patre is a phrase much affected by Plautus, eg. Amph. 365, 614
Dauo prognatum patre, Men. 408, 1078 Moscho prognatum patre. It occurs
on one of the Scipio epitaphs (G.I.L. i. 30) Gnaiuod patre proynatus, fortis
uir sapiensque (see note on v. 295). Summis diuitiis is more likely
to have the sense of ‘a very wealthy house' (cf. Trin. 605 sine dote itte
illam in tantas diuitias dabit ?, Poen. 904 Is in diuitias homo adoptauit
hunc), and to be governed by proynatum, than to be Abl. of Description
(eg. v. 279 A. que honore est illic .? B. Summo). Diuitiis is here and
occasionally elsewhere (liud. 542, Poen. prol. 60, Trz‘n. 682) pronounced
ditiis. This trisyllabic pronunciation is the only one used by Terence.
But, however pronouneed, the word is always spelt in full in our MSS.
