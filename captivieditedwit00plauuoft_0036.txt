and S-Stems), of curor, moneor, dicor (116. (l Sg. Pres. Ind.), of
curantor, dicunto‘r (3 Pl. Pres. Imperat)

But -tur of curatur, curetur, leyitur &c (3 Sg. Pres.) had always a short
vowel, originally ὅ (Gk. ο of ἐ-λέὙε-το &c.), then a. The derivation of igitur
is unknown3 also of mulier (maliEr es Mil. 1223, v.l. mulieris).

The vowel in these terminations, too, was originally long. Orator
had the long 0 of ῥήτωρ, dicor, dicuntor of dico, (ἤσκητο. But final r
exercised the same shortening effect on a preceding long vowel as
'was exercised by final t, though not perhaps so rapidly. Ennius
Ι seems not to know the short scansion ((ἐεῑιιῖὄγ A. 455 Μ.) 3 but it is
the scansion of Lucilius (eg. stricl‘o‘r Inc. 90 M.,frwnisco‘r xviii. 3 M..)
Final η did not affect the quantity of a preceding long vowel, e.g.
audin, Asin. 598 dm, sponclen, from audis-ne, spondes-ne, samin
Ι from sanas-ne (as in the iambic line-ending sanan es? Truc. 364) 3
1 but final l had this effect after the time of Plautus, e.g. class. animal.
:³ This -al of bacchanal, animal «116. was originally -ale (N eut. Sg. of
Adj. in alis), and in Plautus' time these words had probably the
accent on the final syllable (App. ἓ 7) and retained the long vowel,
animal, &c

Examples of these scansions are: (ιηιῦν Merc. 590, sor5r Poen. 895 (for a
fuller list 566 C. F. Miiller, Plaut. Prosodie)

ita mi in pectore atque in corde facit amor incendium.
eedem quo soro'r illius altera Anterastilis,

thther &existar may be the Plautine scansion is not clear. See Poen. 1176,
Truc. 315, 5³3, Mil. 1041 (at the diaeresis), cist. 15. Analogy points to -ῦν.

2. Others were long by position (ending in a double consonant)
in the time of Plautus, while in Class. Latin they took exclusively
the pronunciation (with a single consonant) which at an earlier period
they had only before a word beginning with a consonant. Thus
while Plautus and his contemporaries pronounced miless impransus
and mile-s· pransus (cf. lcocc erac and hoc fuit), the later usage recog-
nized only the pronunciation with one s (Lat. Lany. iii. ξ 50).

¹ On the oldest Latin (und (irent-k) inscriptions a double consonant is always
written single, though of course pronounced double. But about the time of
Plautus the new fashiou of writing it double was coming in (Lat. Lany. i. 58).
