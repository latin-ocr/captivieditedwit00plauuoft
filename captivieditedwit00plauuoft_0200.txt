a line in the MSS. represents a line or two lines or a line and a half of the
original. In this Canticum, however, short lines are frequent in the MSS.
(eg. vv. 197, 204, 205, 206², 2062 &c.), so that we may conclude that the
older distribution has hardly, if at all, been departed from.

Another difficulty is that we have not specimens extant of the models
on which the Plautine Cantica were constructed (Introd. iii. ξ 2). These
must have been developements of the choruses of the later Attic dramatists,
Euripides and his successors, but how precisely they had diverged from the
original type we cannot tell. An editor of Plautus is always exposed to the
danger of associating metres whose association Plautus would never have
tolerated, or of imposing a scansion on lines which is made possible by the
elastic prosody of Plautine Latin, but which Plautus never intended the
line to bear.

The arrangement in this edition supposes the Canticum to begin with
an Iambic passage, Octonarii (Tetrameters Acatalectic) varied in v. 197 by
a Dimeter and terminated by a Septenarius (Tetr. Catal.) v. 200. The
transition to Cretics (vv. 204 sqq.) is marked by the Troehaic lines (v. 201
and probably v. 203), which are interrupted by a reversion to the Iambic
rhythm in v. 202, where a proverbial maxim is put in its natural setting,
an Iambic Senarius. The Cretic passage is intel-rupted by an Iambic
‘echo' (v. 206², an lambio Dimeter), and is terminatcd by an Ithyphallic
colon (v. 207 sentio ..‹z917t2?s), which is found elsewhere at the end of Cretics
(eg. Cure. 121, Pseud. 264). Two Trochaic Octonarii convey Tyndarus’
protest and the reply of the loo-arms (vv. 208—209). Then the Cretic
Metre is resumed and continues (intel-rupted by a Trochaic Octonarius
at v. 215) until V. 222. A couple of lambio Tetrameters (catalectic and
acatalectic) prepare the way for Bacchiacs (vv. 226—230). Then some
mixed Anapaestic and Iambic lines (vv. 231—3) form a transition to
Cretics (VV. 234—239). Finally two Trochaic Octonarii (w. 240›—-1) open
the dialoguc-rnetre <Tr-och. Septonarii) with which the Scene is concluded.
