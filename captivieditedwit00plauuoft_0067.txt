ch. i. ἓ 18), be disproved by an examination 01 the facts. If we find
that the instances 01 hiatus on which our MSS. agree, admit 01
being grouped round one or two types, and that these types 01 hiatus
have in themselves an intrinsic probability, then we shall have
grounds for ascribing the hiatus to Plautus himself. Of course the
two ancient recensions which these MSS. represent may from the
first have shared in a certain number, probably a very limited
number (i. g 18), 01 corrupt readings which left a 13180 11131118 in
this or that line 3 while other corruptions (especially the ‘moderni-
zation ’ 01 11111311111131 1011118 like illic Nom., illic Dat, illunc, horunc,
ipsus, med, ted, zui) may have found their way at different periods
into the one text and the other with the same result. But while all
this makes the discovery 01 Plautus' actual rules 01 Hiatus a difficult
task, it does not by any means make it impossible.

That Latin h had at some early (probably very early) period a stronger 80111111
(cf. dialectal foscis 101 hostis, like our dialectal ‘thos’ for ‘througshw than it had
in 013881031 Latin is certain. I can however see no reason for believing it to
have retained this in Plautus' time (cf. ξ 15), and cannot accept the theory that
initial h may disqualify elision in Plautine verse. (Birt in Rheinisches Museum,
liv. 40, gives a full list of available passages.) Plautus left hiatus in, e.g., ‘qui
amat’ as readily as in, e.g.‚ ‘qui habet.⁷

lines 01 Plautus, so strongly supported by the evidence 01 MSS. and

by analogy from other Latin poetry or by ‘ a priori' considerationS,
as to seem worthy 01 0111· acceptance'l

1110 011101 extreme from Bitschl and accepts many apparent examples 101 which
the manuscript evidence is not sufficiently free from doubt. He adopts also
what seems to me a mistaken principle, and pays regard 10 1110 nature 01 the
ending (an, -ᾶ, -ἑ, 010.) of the words rather than to the intonation of the clause
in which they stand. There is no evidence that one long vowel was treated
differently from another in respect of hiatus or that a final syllable in -m was
not in this respect precisely on a par with a final long vowel—any long vowel.
