11. PRosom'. 47

an initia] vowel, but is scanned as a short syllable. That this
treatment was a natural tendency of the language we see from
words like prehendo for prae—hendo, comest, comitium (but coetus),
circdit (but circitor, with elision) for circum-it. A short vowel
is ended, e.g. suaveolens pronounced suav’olens, antehac pronounced

anc'hac ¹.

Instances of Hiatus and os Elision in Compounds or W'ord-groups are:
introibis Bacch. 907, intr(o) ibo Pers. 77, «ἵνα, inm-Merit Trin. prol. 10,
circzlmirier Cure. 451, circffmis Rud. 140, circ(um)itione Andr. 202, domum)-
itionem (spelled domuitionem Pacuvius 172 R. 3 for the pronunciation cf. Rhetor.
ad Herenn. iii. 21. 34). With the hiatus in flayiti27nz-1167niozis (the normal
ictus and apparently aecentuation) compare inanit-emitto (Cure. 497). We find
elision in anim(um)-a‹lverto.

39. So ineagre and uncertain are our remains of Saturnian
Verse that it seems impossible to formulate with certainty the
precise laws of the metre, and it is clangerous to quote from them
precedents for any practice in Latin versification2. Stil] the patent
regard in that early metre for the number of syllables in the line
entitles one to say that it is at least probable that (l) a long final
vowel, (2) a final syllable ending in -m, were allowed in Saturnian
Verse to stand in this kind of Hiatus before an initial vowel, as a
short final vowel would not be allowed, e.g. patrem suum supremum
optumum 1 appellat, like dabunt malum Metelli Naevio poetae. (For
details see Amor. ιῙοῑινη. Ρὴίίοἰ. xiv, 309.)

In other branches of Latin poetry we find the same practice, e.g.

Virg. Ecl. viii. 108 credimus? an qui amant ipsi sibi somnia
fingunt?

Catull. xcvii. l non (ita me di ament) quicquam referre
putavi.

These two scansions are not artificial soansions. They reflect the actual
pronunciation of these phrases in everyday life. In Plautus qui is similarly
treated in the phrases qui amat, qui amant, qui habet, qui habent, 620. (for
instances, see Journ. Phil. xxvi. 296), and the adjuration has the metrical form
ἱῑα me di ament normally (for instances, see Hauler's note on Ter. Phorm. 165).

Virg. Aen. vi. 507 ίέ, amice, nequivi, Hor. S. 1. ix, 38 si me
amas, S. 11. ii. 28 cocto mim adest honor idem‘l ,- Lucret. ii.

‘quantitative' theory of the Saturnian Metro.
