1. Hos quos uidetis...hi stant. In Plautus we notice a predilection
for the inclusion in the Relative clause of the Subject or Object of the
sentence (cf. V. 179 meliorem adferet Quae mi atque amicis placeat condicio
mayis, and see note on v, 908). The same construction appears in Virgil
A. i. 573 Urbem quam statuo uestra est, as well as in the colloquial Latin
of Terence (eg. Eun. 653 Eunuchum quem dedisti nobis, quas turbas deditl)
and the other Republican Dramatists. Often the Subject or Object is
found in both clauses, eg. Mil. 140:

Nam unum conclaue concubinae quod dedit
Miles, quo nemo nisi eapse inferret pedem.
In eo conclaui ego perfodi parietem 3

and this repetition, which looks like a laboured attempt at securing
distinctness‚ is a feature of legal Latin, eg. quam rem praetor ex Ιιαε (eye
egerit, si eam rem, &c For the repetition of the Demonstrative Pronoun,
as here, cf. Poen. 770 Hi qui concilicmerzmt...id mmo ltz's cerebrum uritur,
and V. 110 below (F ull statistics of this Attraction in Latin will be
found in Bach, de Attractz‘om qvae dicitur Inversa apud scriptores Latinos.
Strassburg, 1888.)

2. Illi quia. astant. Violent alterations of the reading (Illi quz'astant)
of the archetype of our MSS„ such as z‘ta uincti qui astant (Niemeyer), or
iuyati (ui iuncti) qui astant (Schoell), or non mli quia stant (Speyer), are
quite uncalled for. The mere change of quart-stant into quia astant gives a
perfectly satisfactory sense. Illa? are the disturbers at the back of the
theatre‚ late-coniers who are trying to find a seat. “The prisoners on the
stage are standing up as a compliment to our friends at the back there,”
who are forced to stand because they are too late to find sitting-mom.
Astant, often of standing at the door, waiting outside, eg. Rea-ch.. 1134
A. Coyantztr quidem intro....B. Sto sine astent. Hi. The confusion in
Latin MSS. between hi (hit), his (hiis), case-forms of ln‘c, and ί (ii), is (iis)
case-forms of is, is so universal that editors have no scruple in setting
aside the evidence of Mss. in this particular. Here, however, ln· is
required to point the contrast to illi (cf. v. 130, Mil. 1007). Even where
this marked contrast is absent the repetition of ltz‘c seems to have been
the rule in cases of attraction of an antecedent hie, for the reading Itis is
strongly attested in Poen. 770 (quoted in note on ν. 1). Ambo, beside
duos (v. 1), as in Bacch. 569 A. Quid? dmm? B. Atque ambas sorores,
