11. PRosonr. ⁷23

There is clearly assonance between avidi and audi in Bacch. 276 :

Quin tu andi. Immo ingenium auidi haud pernoram hospitis,
(cf. Catullus xi. 1 Rau(i)de)‚ but it is not the v which is suppressed but the
following letter (cf. audeo, older (Tridco Rud. 538, ‘to have a mind for,’ then ‘to
dare‚' from avidus). Cf. ‘nauta (Mil. 1430) beside ndzrita (Men. 226). Full
details regarding the shortened form of the V-Perfect are given by Engelbrecht
in Wiener Studien vi.; Brock, Qnaest. Gramm. ii. The contraction of -ῐυῐ- is
the commonest, e.g. perit, emit, abit (App. ἕ 8), peri (cf. C. Ι. L. iv. 3001 perci,
a disyll.)‚ διο. But -ᾶυῐε probably did not contract. So not eg. ‘amat’ (cf.
Lucr. i. 703 vi. 587) for ανηᾶυῐι, ‘adnumerant' (wrongly read in Asin. 501 by
Leo): —dmus for -ᾶυῖηιιιε is less objectionable‚ eg. enarramus Ad. 365 3 cf. Ο. Lat.
nomus. That a contracted form like peri may elide its final vowel is not certain,
e.g. Bacch. 51.

10. metathesis of r. Plzvyrqio is apparently allowed by
Plautus in Aul. 508 :
Stat fullo, phyrgio‚ aurifex, lanarius,
though in all other passages the form used is plzryqio. On the
other hand tarpessica is perhaps the only form used, since trapessita
seems never to be really required by the metre (in Epid. 143 we
should probably read quo a tarpessita).

Other probable examples are aruio (Poen. 778) for νᾶυῑο (where however the
alliteration favours τᾶυὶο), Ρτόοαῐεηα (Mil. 1060) for porculena, corcotarius (Aul.
521) for c›·6cot‹1r[us.

11. Popular forms of some Greek words Certain loan-
words from the Greek which were in every-day use are admitted by
Plautus in what we may call their ‘plebeiam' or unliterary form.
An uneducated Roman in pronouncing a Greek word put stress—
accent on the same syllable on which the Greek accent (i.e. pitch-
accent) rested, without concerning himself about maintaining the
proper quantitative pronunciation of the syllables. Greek εἴδωλον
became idolum, Σοφία became Sqficm abyssus (ἄβυσσος) is in
Christian (popular) poetry scanned as a tribrach. This change
of quantity is rigorously debarred by Augustan poets except in
words in which it had established itself too strongly to be removed,
e.g. άησόγα (ἆγκῦρα). Another ‘plebeian’ pronunciation of Greek
gave to Greek χ a sound, whose precise nature is matter of doubt,
but which had the effect of lengthening by position the preceding
vowel. One mispronunciation of this kind which firmly established
itself in Latin is bracchium for Gk. βράχῖον, lit. ‘the shorter part of
the arm’ <from the shoulder to the elbow). In Plautus we see these
mispronunciations tolerated in such words as had become part and
parcel of the common language, while in all others the ‘literary'
