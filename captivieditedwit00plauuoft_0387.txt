APPENDIX.

THE ACCENTUAL ELEMEN'I' IN EARLY LATIN VERSE.

1. The Law of Latin Accentuation (known as the ‘ Paenultima Law')
is a very simple one, namely, that the accent falls on the antepenultimate
syllable, if the paenultima be short 3 on the paenultima itself, if long, eg.
de‘cbres, clee5res. The accent never falls on the final syllable, except in the
case of syncopated or apocopated words like αόΐτ for abivit, bomne for
lemanem). But there are traces in Latin, as Corssen proved, of an older
Accentuation, by which the accent fell on the first syllable of every word.
Cases of Syncope like quindecim for quinque-decem, and of Vowel-reduction
like triennium from tri- (tres) and (cmm-3, concido (conceido) from cum and
caedo (wido), point unmistakably to an early quinque-decem, tri-anniam, σόη-
caido, &Q At what precise period the change, no doubt a gradual one, from
this older Accentuation to the Paenultima Law began and completed itself,
it is difficult to ascertain. But there is some evidence that it was still
incomplete in one particular in the period of the Early Drama, for words
(or endings of words) of the metrica] form *vv* seem at that period to
have been still accented on the first and not on the antepenultimate
syllable. Thus balineae <the Plautino form), pueritia, &c seem to have
had in Plautus⁷ time the accentuation balineae, pueritia, which explains
their subsequent reduction to balneae, puertia (cf. Hor. actae non alio reqe
puertiae)¹. And a word like dimidius (from medius) was probably still
accented on the first syllable about 250 Rc.. for the change of unaccented
ἔ to i seems not to be earlier than that time, and is not found on the oldest
inscriptions. But though we cannot fix the time when Latin words passed
from the old to the classica] accentuation, when, for example, sapientia

became sapientia, tempestatibus became tempestatibus, we can guess, partly
from the analogy of other languages, partly from the inherent probabilities

of the case, what the nature of that change was. A long word like sapientia,
tempestatibus must have had at all periods a secondary as well as a main
