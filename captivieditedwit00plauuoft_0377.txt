Terence (Gramm. Lat. ed. Keil, vi. p. 561, 8): Sise=uua...iu Captivis sie hio
ornatu 3 litteram metri causa amisit. Ritschl referred it to v. 447. Many
ingenious theories have been made to explain Sisenna's meaning; but none
can be called satisfactory.

Act V. Scene iv. (Trochaic Septenarii). Tyndarus is brought on
the stage <from the left side) in his labour-garb, loaded with chains
(v. 1025), and carrying a pickaxe (upupa v. 1004). He is told of his
relationship to Hegio and the play ends happily.

998 sqq. These lines are spoken by Tyndarus as he crosses the
stage.

998. Multa saepe. See note on v. 44. Picta. Such paintings were
common in antiquity. The most famous was the picture by Polygnotus in
the Lesche or arcade of Delphi, described by Pausanias. Another was by
Nicias, a contemporary of Praxiteles. Cf. Demosth. Aristoy. i. 52 οἱ ζωγράφοι
τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς ἐν ’Ἀιδου γράφουσιν. A large number of amphorae from Apulia
have paintings of this kind. On the walls of Etruscan tombs Charon, the
messenger of death, appears as a hideous monster, in contrast to the mild
treatment by the Greek painters of the punishments in the other world. (See
Gardner, Sculptured Tombs, ch. iii. ; Dieterich, Nelcyz'a, p. 138.) Acherunti,
probably with long ι’, like Sicyoni Cist. 156. The Locative case-suffix of
Consonant stems was -ῑ, which became -e, eg. Οανίήαρίηε, rure. Third
Decl. forms like Curtltaya'nz, ruri, ›Sia-you& Acherunti seem to have been
originally Ablatives in -zd (see note οη v. 914). This Locative of Acheruns
recurs in v. 689. In Greek Ἀχέρων is Masc.; but the Latin popular form
A(c)elteruus was Fem., as we see from v. 999 and from a draniatic quotation
in Cicero Tusa. 1. xvi. 37: aperto aar ostio Attae Acheruntis. On the form
see Introd. ii. ξ ll. fierent, Subj„ as in Men. 143 enumquam tu
