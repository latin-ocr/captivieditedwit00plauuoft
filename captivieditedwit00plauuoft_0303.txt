Act III. Scene v. This Scene offers the strongest possible contrast
to the bustling comedy of the last. The verse now becomes the Iambic
Senarius‚ of a type far more free from resolved syllables than the ordinary
Senarius of Comedy. In fact the metr-e, as well as the language, of a great
part of the scene has more of the tragic than the comic style. Not merely
the noble sentiments of Tyndarus (vv. 682 sqq.‚ 739 sqq), but also the
reproaches uttered by Hegio (vm 670 sqq.‚ 751 sqq.) are expressed in
measured‚ sonorous verse, which is inconsistent with any extravagance of
feeling or utterance. Hegio is not represented as ranting in a passionate
outburst of fury. He retains the dignified bearing that he displayed in
his first appearance on the stage, though in this Scene the stern side,
as in Aet Ι. Sc. ii. the humorous side, of his character is revealed. His
concluding remarks in this Scene shew more sorrow than anger, and his
tone throughout is one of righteous indignation, not of capricious passion.

The relation of this Scene to the last is similar to that of Sc. iii. to Sc. ii.
of Act 11. A change of metre (from Trochaic Septenarii to Iambic Senarii),
but not a change of speakers, marks the change of Scene. At the end
Tyndarus is led off to hard labour in the quarries.

659. The missing word can hardly be maxumas (Brix‚ Schoell), for the
manicae are not chains, like the catenae maiores of v, 113. They are merely
the lora of v. 658.

660. Rogas ἱ), ‘what a question ! '‚ a common use, eg. Aul. 634 A. Quid
tibi uis reddam? B. Rogas? Sometimes rogitas takes the place of royas,
eg. Aul. 339 A. Qui uero? Β. Ιίοῃίίαεῖ The sentence which precedes is
usually a question with quis (quid, δια), and the sentence that follows is
usually a reply to this question, cg. Epz‘d. 64 A. Amatne istam... :⁹
B. Royas? Deperit.

661. Sartor, the O. Lat. form of saritor, ‘a hoer,' recurs in Varro
Men. 564. The assonance with sator (sator sartorque is certainly the right
