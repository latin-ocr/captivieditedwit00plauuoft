38 INTRODUCTION.

26. For the shortening of a syllable, whether in these Cretic
words or in the others, it is necessary that the preceding syllable be
really short', eg. pati, perpati, The intervention of a Mute and
Liquid, though never lengthening a vowel by ‘position' in Plautus
(eg. never patri, g 30), yet seems to have debarred it from acting
as a ‘Brevis Brevi-ans? The examples of shortenings like patri,
perpetro (for a full list of conceivable instances see Peters in
Harvard Studies, ix. 115) are so rare that they are in all likelihood
illusory. For quadringentos (eg. Rud. 1324) we should probably
read quadi-{qentoa the older form (Lat. Lany. vi. ἓ 77; denied by
Skutsch in Deutsclce Litteraturzeithy 1895, p. 1294).

27. The intervention of qu seems to have operated, though not
so decidedly, in the same direction. While shortenings of the type
loci are freely admitted, shortenings of the type loqui are not very
frequent. The combination -quo- appears to have interfered least
with the shortening. At any rate, loquor (eg. Cas. 166), sequor are
so frequent that they cannot be questioned, which can hardly be said
of loquar, sequar (eg. Cist. 698 persequar), loqui, sequi.

28. On the other hand a long final syllable (or syllable ending

in 7η) shortened in hiatus (below, g 40) is a perfectly acceptable
‘Brevis Brevians,' e.g. δί &ffeoeis hoc (Cas. 709).

And the addition of -que, -ne does not make the shortening
impossible, if these Enclitics are elided (ξ 29³), eg. prospereque) Ἴ
Amph. 463 (cf. Pseud. 574), yressqasp) huic Asin. 3, viden (ἓ 16).

29. It is commonly said that no syllable under the ictus can
exhibit this shortening (Seyffert in Berl. Phallol. I'Vockeusclcr„ 1891,
p. 77), so that in a line like Truc. 698 (lamb. Senar.) :

ubi male accipiar mea mihi pecunia,

we must scan uhi male decipiar, with ubi Iambus, and not ub& male
accipiar, with the first foot a trib1·ach; and in Liv. Andr. Traq.
38 R. (lamb. Senar.):

quem ego nefrendem alui lacteam immulgens opem,

editors resort to the extremely doubtful scansion m’ffrendem in order
to avoid quem (390⁵ πᾶ». But to ascribe to the mere incidence of the
ictus or beat of the line any influencc over the quantity of a syllable A

¹ The s (ss) that stood for Gk. ζ· necessarily lengthened a syllable, so that ¹
‘mnnisonnrii’ (from Gk. ζώνη) of ilnl. 516 (senml somarii Leo) is impossible.
