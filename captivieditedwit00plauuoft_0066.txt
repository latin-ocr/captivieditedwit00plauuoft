44 INTRODUCTION.

Naevius, and probably only in their non-dramatic writings. To
Plautus, in whose time the final (l after a long vowel (except in med,
ted, ξ 5) seems to have been as definitely dropped in pronuncia-
tion as our final h in ‘lamb,' the use of such a form in his lines
which were reproductions of the language of every-day life was im-
possible. Cicero⁷s statement must be accepted as an expression of the
opinion of competent criticism in the last century of the Republic,
that hiatus was a feature of early, in contrast to contemporary, poetry.

36. Now this opinion is one that cannot be arbitrarily put
aside. Ritschl's attempt to restrict hiatus in Plautus within the
narrow limits to which Terence seems to confine it (see Leo
Plauc. Fons-072. 3), involves too much tampering with the MSS. (cf.
Klotz Grundzziye, p. 14). Why should we accept the evidence of the
MSS. for line aiter line and reject it as soon as an hiatus appears‘.l

One answer to this question has recently been given which
would throw discouragement on our efforts to discover Plautus’ usage
in regard to hiatus. It is said1 that the earliest edition of the
works of Plautus was made at that archaizing period in the Early
Empire, when the belief that each and every form of hiatus was
tolerated in the archaic poetry shewed itself in the verses written in
imitation of the early style? And it is argued that the editors,
while they would use the resources then available to thern, but now
lost to us, in reniedying other defects of the lines, would make no
attempt to remedy a line which suffered from hiatus. They would
not recognize hiatus as a defect. So when our MSS. (APA) agree
in exhibiting a line with hiatus, we should not, it is urged, believe
that this is the form in which Plautus wrote the line, but we should
accept it as a corrupt form, which might have been emended by the
ancient editors with the help of the materials at their command, but
which we at this late period can hardly hope to emend.

This theory, it appears to me, may, like its neighbour-theory
of the close connexion of our two earliest MSS„ A and PA (above,

1 Leo, Plazetfinische Forsclumqen, ch. i. His views are criticized by Seyffert
in Rerl. I'hilol. Issovhwzscrhrist‚ 1896, pp. 234, 2134, by Redslob in Literni-ischas
Gentralbhaett, 1895, p. 1761, and by others. Leo in his edition of Plautus leaves
as a rule unomended all lines whose only defect is Hiatus, even those for which
we have only the evidence of P, a single mediaeval MS. (i. ξ 3). Since mediaeval
scribes erred as often in omitting a syllable or word as in inserting one, the
number of lines of this kind is naturally very considerable, and quite disfigures
Leo's text. The S11bs0quent discovery of the readings of Τ has here and there
supplied the omission.

2 The acrostic Arguments of the plays of Plautus favour Hiatus. See my note
on the Argument os the Captivi.
