Alo-st. 1134 A. Age mitte ista ac tu ad me ad cenam—B. Dic uentu-
rum; quid taces'.l (acto MSS, istaec, te Ritschl, fort. istaec,
tu).

In one of these passages (Cas. 208) the form istaec is required by the metre3
in another (the 11110 under discussion) either the form istaec or some change
of the reading of the MSS. is required3 in two (Asin. 860 and 578) the
change of ista to istaec is supported by the traditional text, and in the
remaining three the removal of the doubtful form is effected without
violence to the MSS. (eg. in Amph. 589 the loss of -ec before ex· of expetant
is very natural).

On ⁴ a priori' grounds there is no objection to the forms istud and ista.
Since illud is in use along with illue, illa along with ίίἰαεσ, we should be
prepared to accept istud and ista as at least occasiona] by-forms, if the
evidence of the MSS. were sufficient. That evidence however, if care-
fully examined, seems to me to pronounce so strongly against these forms,
that we are driven to the conclusion that by some caprice of language,
istud and ista were not admitted to the diction of Plautus and Terence.
Leo retains ista in this line and adds ac before die. But the besetting sin
of scribes was rather the effacing of the Early Latin Asyndeton in such
cases (see note on v. 658). Both aufer (&c.) dic (&c.) (eg. Poen. 1035
Maledicta hinc aufer, lingnam compescas face) and aufer (&c.) ac dic (810.)
(eg. Οἴει. 747 Sed quaeso ambaqes, mulier, mitte atque hoo aye) were
permissible expressions in Plautus (see note 011 v. 540). A corruption in
a MS. would take the form of the insertion of atque or αο rather than of
the omission of the copula. Indeed so frequent is this insertion as to
suggest a certain amount of doubt about any line where the copula is
not required by the nietre. Hence Cure. 245 (quoted above) is not 80
satisfactory evidence of the 1180 of the copula as Cist. 747, and the removal
of the copula in Asin. 578, Most. 1134 18 a method of emendation to which
exception cannot be taken.

965. Dictis uolo conpendium. This reading involves the least
possible depalture from the MSS, which offer dictis c. nolo. Since the
usual construction in Plautus 18 aliquid compendi facere (Asin. 307, Bacch.
183, Most. 60, Pers. 471, l’oon. 351, Pseud. 1141, Tmo. 376), most editors
rewrite the phrase in this form, dicta conpendi uolo. But we have other
instances in Plautus of departure from the normal form of the phrase:
