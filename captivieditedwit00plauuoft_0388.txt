358 PLAVTI CAPTIVI.

accent3 it could hardly be pronounced otherwise, as we can see from our
own pronunciation of such words as ‘characteristical' (with secondary
accent on first, main accent on fourth syllable). So that the old accentua-
tion sapientia would be more accurately expressed as sdpientz‘a. The
change from the old accentuation to the new would be, in reality, nothing
but a usurpation by the secondary accent of the prominence of the main
accent: sapientia would become scipie'ntia, tempestatibus would become
tempestatibus. The secondary accent of long words is generally ignored in
the Latin Grammarians' accounts of accentuation, though it seems to be
what Varro alludes to by the term media prosodia. But in any investi-
gation of the relation of the metrica] ictus to the natural accent of words
in Plautus, we must bear it in mind. Even four-syllabled words of the
form -ννῑ, eg. flayitium, may have retained in his time a distinct
secondary acoent (the old main accent) on the first syllable as well as the
main accent (the old secondary accent) on the paenultima, flciyitiuml.
We must also remember that balineae, pueritia, &c., not balineae, pueritia,
&c., seem to have been the Plautine accentuations.

2. The Latin accentuation of the sentence, as distinguished from the
accentuation of words by themselves, may be determined with a fair
amount of accuracy, partly by the help of the remarks of the Latin
Grammarians, partly from observing the phonetic changes of Latin words
and of their descendants in the Romance tongues, where an accented word or
syllable is not subject to the same laws of development as an unaccented,
partly from the analogy of other languages. Examples of Sentence-enclitics
are: (1) Enclitic Particles like que, υὲ, m? (Interrogative). These were
written as appendages of the preceding word, eg. Caesarque, Ciceroque,
atque (weakened in pronunciation to *octog ac); (2) the various parts of the
Substantive Verb, eg. est, sunt, erat, erit, foret, &c Es, est are written in
the best MSS. of Plautus, Virgil, &c., as appendages of a Pers. Part. Pass,
amatus (printed by us amatu's), oematust, armatast, amatumst for amatus-es,
amatus-esc, amata-est, amatum—est. It need hardly be said that the extent
to which these words, and indeed all Sentence-enclitics, were suppressed,
would depend on the caprice of the speaker, on the nuance of thought,
on the style of composition, &c No hard and fast rule can be laid down
about them, just as no rule could be made for the use of ‘'s’ for ‘is‚'
‘'re' for ‘are in English. (3) The personal‚ possessive and demonstrative
pronouns when unemphatic. U nemphatic ille has dwindled into the
definite article in Romance. (4) Auxiliary Verbs like do, volo (our ‘will,⁷
‘shall’) in verbal word-groups like pessum-clo, cocceam-(labo, factum-volo,
and even in other word-groups, eg. quontmn-vis. (5) Nouns of sub-
ordinate meaning like res (cf. our ‘some-thing,' ‘no-thing'), eg. qud-re,

¹ The incidence of two accents, one main and the other secondery, on
neighbouring syllables has nothing unnaturul about it. Cf. our ‘fortnightly‚'
‘househol‹ler,’ Germ. ‘‹=ntsagen.' The Ilalian spelling svppelire (Lat. sepelire),
scellerato (Lat. sceleratus) is due to the secondary accent on the initial syllable.
