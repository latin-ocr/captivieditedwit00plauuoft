10 INTRODUCTION.

and ΡΑ. For example, Charisius, speaking of Bacch. 545, sayS‚
‘in quibusdam non ferunt.7 In A the passage, vv. 540—551, is
omitted, but it is present in ΡΑ. Ι11 the Dictionary of Verrius
Flaccus, epitomized by Festus, Epid. (520 is quoted under the letter
G for the word 97·avastellus, under R for ravistellus. The former is
the reading of ΡΛ, 13116 latter of A1. Differences in the text would
arise from the re—casting of plays by stage-managers at the revival
of a play. A whole Scene might be substituted for 13116 original one;
as, for example, both A and PA offer two versions of the final Scene
of the Poenulus, 0116 (vv, lma—1422) directly following the other
(vv. 1338—1371) (cf. Stich.. 48-57). Or a Scene that seemed 1300
long or too short might have a passage removed 01· added 3 as in the
last Scene of the Captivi vv. 1016—1022 are omitted in A, but are
present in ΡΑ. Or an archaic phrase or construction might be
modernized‚ e.g. Bacch. 519 narret Zoyos (A), dicat iocum (ΡΑ),
Pseud. 432 forssuat cm istaec (A), fors sit aa ea tihi (ΡΑ). Occasion-
ally what seems a variant of this last kind is really a corruption,
the modern form having been written as a gloss above the archaic
form for the convenience of the reader, and having been mistaken by
a subsequent copyist for a correction of the text. It is probably in
this way that the word r090, the stock explanation of Ο. Lat. oro in
the Dictionaries of the Empire, has ousted the Plautine oro in Most.

682 bonum aequomque oras (ΡΑ) 111 A, and in Pers. 321 quod mecum
dudum orasti (A) in ΡΛ.

18. The existence of rival versions had the natural result that
one edition was provided with marginal varieties from another
edition. We have many traces of this practice in A and ΡΑ. Ι11
Pseud. 864, for instance, 0116 version had at the end of the line
conquiniscito (A), another had ceueto simol (Nonius). In PA (or
its original) stood caueto simul with conquiniscito written either in
the margin or above ceneto, whence the reading of 13116 minuscule
MSS: conquimssscito simul. In Pseud. 392 one version of the line
appeared in PA : ea· multis, esequire ea: illis ‘anema qui certus siet, the
other version: exc multis, em illis parteis umam qui certast cedo had
apparently in tho original of A the marginal variant ewquire, which has
produced in A this curicus lino : ca· multis atque est-quire eoo illis paucis
unum qui carbasa cudo. On the strength of some cases of agreement

¹ Of tho four passages os Plautus cited in this Dictionary with variants,

three arc preserved both in PA and A. In each of these three one variant
appears in A, the other in ΡΛ.
