APPENDIX. 365

of Plautus and even of Terence, unless where the presence of an enclitic
causes a shifting of the accent. (Similarly with word-endings of this form,
eg. pue'rz'tia, a noun which takes the ictus on the second syllable in its
single occurrence in Terence, Haut. 183:

Abduxi ad cenam: nam mihi magna cum eo iam inde a pueritia.)
Words of the type —=—*—‘, eg. tempestate, advertite, are by the nature of
Iambic and Trochaic verse restricted to the ictus tempestate, ddmmite,
which corresponds with their accentuation tempestate, advenum and much
the same is true of words of the type νν--ϊ, eg. sepelire, sceleratos (see
ξ 1 n.). Choriambic words, e.g. consilium, dimidius, have usually the
ictus consilium, dimidius, which corresponds to their accentuation under
the Paenultima LaW, though the ictus c6nsz'lz'um, dimidius, &c (like the

older accentuation of the first syllable, ξ l) is not at all infrequent.

Other combinations of four syllables of the type *vv*- are freely used with
ictus on the second of the group, eg. Is e‘tiam (Epid. 524), Αη ‹ibiit (Mero. 981),
where ictus and accent would not be in conflict. Similarly in combinations of
three syllables of the type vv: other than in trisyllabic words or in the endings
of polysyllabic words the ictus is readily allowed on the second of the group,
e.g. Sed zzbz‘ (Rud. 465). This shews that it is considerations of the natural
accentuation of these Fourth Paeon and Tribrach words which determine their
metrical treatment by the Latin Dramatists.

11. To pass to the Accentuation of the Sentence. The Iambic aad
Trochaic metres‚ which Plautus and Terence employ in their dialogue-
scenes, are the metres which come nearest to the language of conversation.
Since the diction of these poets is patently the diction of the ordinary life
of the time, and their dialogue-scenes reproduce all the varied phases of
everyday speech, with its tones of banter and innuendo, of entreaty and
refusal, of threatening, command and deprecation, they afford us an excellent
opportunity of testing how far the sentence-accentuation was regarded in
early Latin poetry. Lines like

Stich. 185 ueni illo ad cenam: sic face.
promitte uer0; ne grauare: est commodum.
uolo, inquam, fieri: non amittam quin eas.

Stich. 93 non sedeo isti: uos sedete: ego sedero in subsellio.
Stich. 632 A. Egone? B. Tune. A. Mshine? B. Tibine, ὅτε.

Mero. 947 ,
ut ualuisti? quid, parentes mei ualent? tam gratiast:
bene uocas, benigne dicis. cras apud te, nunc domi,

have clearly the ‘ipsissima verba’ of actual Roman conversation, and
would be uttered by the actor with the same gesture and tone that would
accompany them in everyday life. Did then this intonation impress itself
on the metre too? Do the emphasizcd syllables receive the ictus or metrica]
beats of the line, and are the subordinate words and unaccented syllables
