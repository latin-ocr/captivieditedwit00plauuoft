11. PRosoDY. 1 9

(6) -ἑὶ 111 Gen. Sing. of Fifth Decl., e.g. ‘rei and fidei, Aul. 121

(Bacchiae) :
meai fidei tuaique rei.

The Gen. Sing. of the Fifth Decl. had originally -ἓῑ (cf. -ᾶῐ of First Decl.).
This became (1) -ἑῐ, eg. re'i (Men. 494, HeqL 807, &c.), fidci; but usually in
Plautus (2) -Ξῖ (cf. -ae of First Decl.), e.g. rei (by some written re)‚fidei (fide,
fidi). The Dat. Sing. had always -AE (cf. -ue, from original -ἇῖ, of First DecL),
until a new Dative form, unknown in the time of Plautus (eg. rei Dat„ Lucr.,

τέῑ Dat„ Horace), was made on the pattern of the Genitive. (For details see
Class. Rev„ x. 424.)

(d) Ξῖ (Dat. Sing. of is), usually a] 3 Ιηῖῖο (Dat. Sing. of laic),
usually Ιιῖιῖο ; quoii (Dat. Sing. of qui, quis), usually quoi or cui.

 

Cure. 544 is Summanum se uocari dixit, ἑῑ reddidi.
Bacch.. 484 mihi discipulus, tibi sodalis periit, Ῐηῑῖσ filius.
Amph. 861 (spoken by Jupiter)

ego sum ille Amphitruo, quoi(i) est seruos Sosia.

Other examples of the fuller form, apparently the more ceremonious and)

emphatic form, are: ἑῑ Aul. prol. 13, Cist. 138, &c.; Ιιῐιῑο Men. prol. 40, Poen. k
395, 1036, Eud. 1342—3. (in a legal formula). Whether quoii (σᾶῐ) be printed
before an initia] vowel or quoi (cui) unelided, is a matter for an editor‘s choice i
in lines like Amph. 861 (just quoted), Haut. 685, Caecilius 261 1²2„ Turpilius
116 R„ Pomponius 146 R. The elision of cui 111 Plautus (ἶ) Asin. 94, Trin. l

1061) is denied by many scholars; cf. Accius Praet. 30 R:
quaeque agunt uigilantes agitantque, ea si c(zcz') in somno accidunt,

where some would make ἔᾶ εἴ cui a proceleusmatic (ξ 13). It should be added that
since linguistic justification οἱ the scansione ἑῐ, Ιιᾶῐε is not yet forthcoming,
they cannot be accepted with perfect confidence.

(e) Chius Adj.‚ Cure. 78, Poen. 699 (for details see Buecheler
in lehem. Mus. 1886) 3 Pellaeus, with short paenultima, Asin. 333
(with long, Asin. 397); &lacu (for details see Richter in Studemund's
Studien i. 438), f‘Z'erl, fierem (sl- allowed at end of line) are other
examples of variation between the Plautine and the classical treat-
ment of a long vowel or diphthong preceding another vowel in the
interior of a word. And others, no doubt, remain to be discovered.

In Terence similarly the scansion fieri, fierem (eg. Phorm. 593) is not
admitted except at the end of the line (i.e. through metrical exigencies). See
Hauler’s note on Phorm. 760. ⁴ 1210ss ‘sium’ is apparently unknown. Editors
change ‘siat ‘ of the MSS. to suat in Aul. 405 816. (cf. Pseud. 1029).

The i of pius was originally long. This quantity is attributed to Ennius
(ap. Cic. Rep. i. 41. 64) pectora pia tenet desiderium (MSS. diu, dia) and may
perhaps occur in Plautus (eg. some scan pietatem in Pseud. 293, Τνιή. 280).

Proprius, from pro and privas, may retain long i in capt. 863 (q.v.)‚ Mero. 338,
Trin. 1130; and possibly prior (the original scansion) is found in Cas. 571, 839,

2—‘2
