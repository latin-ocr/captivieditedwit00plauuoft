46—51. Some or all of these lines have been bracketed by various
editors, but without good reason. It cannot indeed be denied that our
MSS. frequently exhibit two versions of the same passage, one of which
originated from a later representation of a play (see note on vv. 1016 sqq).

Thus the Poenulus contains two versions of the Carthaginian passage
(vv. 930—9 and 940—9),‚and two versions of the end of the same play.

In the case of some dittographies we can see that the one version was
adopted to the exclusion of the other in an early edition or recension
of Plautus. For example, one of the rival versions of the Carthaginian
passage (vv. 930—9) is omitted in the Ambrosian Palimpsest. More
commonly however both versions are found incorporated in our MSS,
though there are often indications that the one was that adopted by the
ancient recension which the archetype of the MSS. follows, while the other
was subsequently jotted on the margin, and only in process of time found
its way from the margin into the text. (See Introd. i. ξ 17,)

Another kind of marginal adscript that was liable to be found in
ancient copies of Plautus may be exemplified from the curious history
of an English play, Sir Jolm Van Olden Barozavelt, by Massinger and
Fletcher. At a passage which strongly suggested Milton's line “ That last
infirmity of noble mind,'' an editor had jottedthis line in the margin.
This jotting the printer incorporated with the text, so that the passage
appears in this edition in this form:

η “Read but o'er the stories
Of men most famed for courage or for counsaile,
And you shall find that the desire of glory
(That last infirmity of noble minds)
Was the last frailty which men e'er put off.’'

A line like v. 48 excites the suspicion that it is a parallel passage, taken
from a similar situation in another play and jotted in the margin of some
early text, whether by a private owner for his own convenience or by an
editor for the information of readers; for marginal adscripts, it must be
remembered, corresponded to the foot-notes in modern editions. On the
other hand, if we picture to ourselves the circumstances under which the
prologuc to this play would be spoken and reincxnber that the garrulous
prolixity of Plautus, the non asm‘etus soccus for which Horace censures
him, was in cases likc this the only means of in‘ipressing on an unin-
tellectual and hecdless audiencc some important incident of a complicated

plot, we shall feel it to be the safer course to leave the passage as it stands
in the MSS.
