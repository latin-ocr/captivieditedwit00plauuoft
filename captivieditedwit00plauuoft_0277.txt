of lively dialogue. The names of the three Zorarii, who come out of the
house at the end of the Scene, are given in v. 657, Colaphus (who speaks
at v. 658), Cordalio and Corax. These names would however probably not
figure in the ancient Scene-heading.

533. Trin. 276 Quo illic homo foras se penetrauit [ex] Aedibus?
Quo illum...hominem proripuisse...se dicam? for quo ille homo pro-
ripuit se? Periphrasis of this type is common in colloquial Latin (cf. vv.
268, 541).

534. The MSS. end this h'ne with Tyndare and the next with fatebor
mihi. To prefix mihi to v. 536 involves the impossible scansion &mnis or
the very unlikely scansion omu(is) in (Introd. ii. ξ 3). To read Res mi
omnis is a great departure from the traditional text. The presence of
milii at the end of v. 535 in the MSS. might be accounted for by the
habit of mediaeval scribes of writing an ‘overfloxv' word of an extra-long
line in the nearest available space. Thus in Asioi. 474-5:

ΜΕ. Malum hercle uobis quaeritis LE. Crura hercle diffringentur,
Ni istum inpudicum percies. LIBANVS. Perii hercle: age, inpudice,

the ‘overflow’ word of v. 475 (inpudice), written 111 the archetype at the
end of the preceding line, is in our MSS. treated as a part of v. 474, which
ends diffiinyentur inpudice, while v. 475 ends with aye (cf. critical notes on
vv. 518—519 of this play). Lindemann therefore makes this line end
with Tyndare: ei om'ln'! It is however quite as likely that milii is a
marginal gloss on v. 536. I suppose hiatus at the pause after occidi
(Introd. ii. ξ 44). Niemeyer breaks up the 11110 into two Trochaic
Dimeters Oatalectic:

Ni'inc enim uero ego occidi:
Eunt ad te hostes, Tyndare.

Enim uero and hercle uero normally precede αφ), while uero follows it, so
that Fleckeisen's conversion of the 11110 into an Iambic octonarius, Enim
ue‘ro nunc 290 occidi. . . Tyndare, cannot be accepted
