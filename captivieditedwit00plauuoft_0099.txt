111. M ETRE. 73

that is to say, beside bhe trochee and bhe spondee, we have tahe
tribrach, the dactyl, the anapaesta, and occasionally ‘che proceleus-
matio. The two last are nob allowed by the Greek Dramatists.

Aul. 730, with its numerous resolved feet, well expresses the agitation of the
speaker:
abeam an maneam, an adeam an fugiam? quid agam ‘?—edepol nescio.

For details of the somewhat limited use of the Proceleusmatic in Latin Trochaic

Verse, see Klotz, pp. 348 sqq. and C. F. Mffller, Nachtriiye‚ pp. 56 sqq.
According to Abraham, Stud. Plaut. p. 228, it is allowed when the fourth syllable
could not take the ictm, e.g. Amph. 442 nimis similest, where the ictus ‘similest’

. would be impossible.
Another example is Trin. 638:

nullum bEneficium esse duco id, quom, quoi facias, non placet.

Ritschl, who disallowed a ‘falling Proceleusmatic ' in Dramatic Verse, pro-
posed to read benficium (Opuse. ii. 720); but his views on this subject are now
generally abandoned.

Podiaski‚ Troch. Sept. Terent. pp. 23 sq„ gives details regal-(ling the compara-
tive frequency of different feet in the various parts of the Trochaic Septenarii of

Terence.

15. The spondee, which in Greek is not admitted into the ‘odd’
feet, the metrically important feet of brochaic dipodies (ἓ 7), is in
Latin admitted into all except] the sevenbh of a Septenarius. But,
as we found with spondees in the even feei, of iambic lines, a marked
discrepancy of mebrical ictus from the natural accenb of the word is
avoided. The ‘irrational’ long syllable is not also the accented

syllable as a rule.

Here are some examples of this unfavoured rhythm :

Capt. 898 Aeternam tibi dapinabo uictum, si uera autumas.
Trin. 648 Praeoptauisti amorem tuum uti uirtuti praeponeres.
Capt. 258 Quos tam grandi sim mercatus praesenti pecunia.

For a fuller list, see Klotz, G7·u⁷td2i1'9e‚ pp. 325 sqq.‚ and cf. above, ἓ 7. Since
a form like ’ἲν-Δ is more tolerated than L-L, he points out the greater likeli-
hood of Prosodic Hiatus than of Elision in beginnings like (Ῑιιᾶηι ᾶν9ενιτιῑιη

(Poen. 519), σιῗπι amicis (Stich. 580), ιιιῖἠι moram (Poen. 584), dcc.

16. The same unpleasing divisions of dactyls and anapaests
between words (ξ 9) are avoided in Trochaic as in Iambic Verse.
For example, a dacbyl of the bype —' ψ, υ is favoured only in the
first foot, (see ὅ 9) of the line or hemistich, eg. Asin. 508 :

hoccine est pietatem colere, Η ωέῐωῆε Imperium minuere‘l

Terence hardly allows it even in the first foot. We have in
Andr. 857, a line beginning with tri-stis effudi-itas (cf. I’ltorm. 863,
