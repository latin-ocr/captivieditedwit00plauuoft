11. PRosonY. 15

Mero. 4893 and this spelling actually occurs on an inscription

(Oarm. Lat. Epiyr. 1038. 5). Even Propertius scans the word long
by position (ii. 32. 61) :

Quod si tu Graias tuque es imitata Latinas.
But we find miles in Ennius (A. 277 Μ.) and Lucilius (xi. 8 Μ.).

Here are some examples of these words in Plautus:

Aul. 528 Mile‘s impransus astat, aes censet dari.
Poen. 388 Huius cor, huius studium, huius savium, mastigia.

(Cf. Pers. 800 and see Buecheler in Rlzseinisches Mus-eum, 1891.)
Bacch. 1127 Rerin εὲν 111 anno tsi has tonsitari? (Bacch.)

Cas. 629 Eripite isti gladium quae suist imp5s animi. (Choriamb.)
Cas. 817 So’spcs iter incipe hoc uti viro tuo. (Ion. a maj.)

The final syllables above enumerated were definitely long in the

time of Plautus¹, as at a later time they were definitely short.
Other differences, however, between Plautine and Augustan prosody

do not rest on so clearly marked distinctions, but rather on a differ-
ence of usage :-ss

3. Final s after a short vowel was so faintly pronounced in the
time of Plautus and Ennius that poets felt no necessity to treat as
long by position a syllable of this kind when followed by an initial
consonant2. But by Oicero’s time this pronunciation had come

to be thought ‘subrusticum ' (Ur. xlviii. 161) and ceased to be recog-
nized in poetry (see Lat. Lcmq. ii. ᾗ 126).

For a discussion of the long and 111οΙ short scansion of such syllables in
Plautus and the early poets see Havct in Etudes ‹lessclie‘es ἲι G. Paris, Paris, 1891 ;

Skutsch in Jalcresberz'clzt Romanischer PJstloJoyie, iv. 82, Maurenbrecher, Hiatus
und Verrschlezjunq, pp. 89 sqq.

Prisis is the normal preconsonantal scansion in Plau tus, and similarly maffis,
nimis, satis (see Leo, Plant. Forsehutmen, p. 208). Lineendings like estis vos,
occidistis me (Bacch. 313) dc, arc common enough. Examples of the long
scansion are, Rud. prol. 1-›2’ (spoken by the god Arcturus):

qui gentes omnes, mariaque et terras mouet,
eicis suin ciuis, ciuitate caelitum,

and in Most. 957 the line-ending civis pater. The long scansion may be taken
for the more ceremonious or careful style oi speaking.

¹ It is wrong therefore to speak of a scansion like mazer, prodes& as an
occasional licence. For Plautus the final syllables must be scanned long and
cannot be scanned short, unless under 1110 influence of the Law of Breves
Breviantes. Thus pater, pines may cxhibit 11. shortcned final syllable, but not
τηᾶεεν, prodes, just as the final ῡ of (Ιᾶνο may bc shortcncd, but not of stato.
The Imperative fer was at all times a short syllable (Lat. Laws. viii. ξ 58).

² In Latin Dramatic Verso this scansion is not indicated 111 0111· printed
