ACT. v. sc. 1v. 355

FRAGMENTVM.

Nonius p. 220, 12: pilleus generis masculini. Plautus Captiuis ‘ pilleum
quem habuit diripuit eumque ad caelum tollit '] deripuit Bothius in nomine
fabulae erratum esse coniecit Schoellius.

Fragm. The line quoted by Nonius is as likely as not to belong to
some other play. The theory that it refers to an incident in the history
of Tyndarus, and was related by his abductor in Act V. Sc. ii„ is out of
keeping with the surly, uncommunicative character attributed by Plautus
to Stalagmus. In view of the usual hiatus in the phrases quem habet, quem
habuit, &c Ι would make pilleum end one line and quem begin another:

pilleum
Quem habuit deripuit eumque ad caelum tollit...
