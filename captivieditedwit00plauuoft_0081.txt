111. METRE. 57

strophio responsion, was characteristic of the Old Comedy and ceased
to exist when the Athenian Empire fell. The New Comedy re-
stricted itself to ‘dialogue-metres,⁷ especially the Iambic Trimeter.
In Menander indeed there are traces of Anapaestic passages (for
details see Blass in Hermes xxxiii. 655); but, so far as the extant
fragments allow us to judge, this metre was used to a very limited
extent. Moreover Menander and Diphilus are mentioned as having
employed the ‘Metrum Eupolideum’ (Mar. Vict. p. 104, 4 K.>;
and the ‘Versus Diphilius⁷ takes its name from Diphilus; but yet
Plautus cannot be supposed to have derived his wealth of metre
from these poets. The Miles Gloriosus, probably one of the earliest
of Plautus’ plays, with its exclusive use of Iambic and Trochaic
metres, except in one Anapaestic passage (vv. loll—1093), seems
to give a fairly correct impression of the N ew Comedy type. So do
the plays of Terence, in which lyric metres are hardly found at all 3
although both he and Plautus are charged with a far more extended
use of Tetrameters than they found in their originals¹. Of Plautus'
plays we may add the Asinaria (127—-137 Cretic), and the Mercator
(vv. 335—-363 Bacchiae and Anapaestic), Which are almost wholly
expressed in Iambics and Trochaies, whereas in a play like the
Casina nearly every actor is provided with a song. The cantica in ²
Roman adaptations from the N ew Comedy thus appear to have been
an clement added from some foreign source in obedience to the
dramatic requirements of the time. In Plautus the cantica are
monodies‚ not part-songs of a chorus2, so that a derivation of them

adfirmare Terentianas vel maxime fabulas metrum ac disciplinam graecarum
comoediarum nou custodisse, id est quas Menander, Philemon, Diphilus et
ceteri ediderunt. nostri enim in modulandis metris seu rhythmis veteris
comoediae scriptores sequi maluerunt, id est Eupolin, Cratinum, Aristophanem,
prologos itaque et primarum scaenarum aetus trimetris comprehenderunt, deinde
longissimos, id est tetrainetros subdiderunt, qui appellantur quadrati. postea in
consequentibus variaverunt: modo enim trimetros, modo addito quadrante vel
semisse posuerunt, id est semipede adiecto vel integro pede iambo vel sesquipede.
haec per medios actus varie; rursus in exitu fabularum quadratos, quales diximus
in secunda scaena, locarunt. Cf. Quintilian⁷s verdict on Terence⁷s plays (x. i.
99): plus adhuc habitura gratiae si intra versus trimetros stetissent. For
examples of the substitution of Latin Tetranieters for (jreek Trinieters see
Terence Hecyra 286 sqq. (zApollodm-us Carystius Ἐκυρά frag. 10 K), 380
(τ-Ἐκ, fras. 11), Ennius Malea lntvul frag. viii. R. (zicurip. Μήδ. 366 sqq.),
etc.. etc. The Troehaie Tetrnmeter was, after the ‹lisuse of Saturnian Verse,
the ‘popular' metre of Reme, used, for instance, ty soldiers in their rude songs
at triumphs, eg. :

ecce Caesar nunc triumphat qui subegit Gallias.

not correspond in any way to the Greek chorus. Probably one of the number
was spokesman for the rest.
