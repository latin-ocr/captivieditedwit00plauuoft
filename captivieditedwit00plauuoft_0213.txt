question is addressed to the guards, who, at the orders given by the
Zorarius just before his departure (vv. 213, 215), had retired to a distance
from the Captives. Quos ante aedis iussi huc produci foras. On
these words has been based the theory that the Captives after the Prologue
were not seen on the stage until Act Π. Sc. i. It is surely much more
natural to suppose the Captives to have remained on the stage from the
beginning of the play3 and there are many indications that this was
actually the case (see notes on vv. 98, Ι. ii. init„ 110, 125, 169, 11. i. init).
Hegio’s remark here need not refer to some order Subsequent to that given
in vv. 114—5. He may be speaking merely of the instructions which are
supposed to have been issued prior to the play, and in compliance with
which the Captives appear on the stage during the Prologue.

253. In quaestione essemus, ‘should be to seek,’ a common phrase.
Similar is in expectatione esse alicui (Mil. 1279). cautum intellego.
These words are assigned to Hegio bya correction (Bss) in the Codex Vetus,
so that the passage would read:

PHIL. Edepol tibi ne in quaestione essemus— ΗΕΘ. Cautum
intellego.
PHIL. Ita uinclis, &c.,

with the same interruption of a speaker⁷s remarks as occurs elsewhere in
Plautus (cf. V. 337). These corrections, which Ι believe to have been taken
from the Archetype (Ρ) from which the immediate original (ΡΜ) of our MSS.
was copied (see Introd. i. ξ 9), are generally to be followed. But not, I think,
in this instance. The breaking up of thc line seems pointless. If we take into
consideration the curicus misspelling in the M SS. chamum (but cautum 13³),
it looks as though in the Archetype the ‘overflow’ words of the line cautum
intelleyo had been written in some availablc space with the customary

symbol, a suprascript II. or ll. S. (‘hoc supplendum'), to indicate the

transposition. I fancy that clintum intelleyo of the Archetype (P) became

chamum intellego in ΡΜ), bnt was understood by the corrector (3³) as
ΗΕΘ. cautum irztellcgso. (Cf. critical note on v. 393.)
