ERGASILvs parasitus.

Aet Ι. Scene i. Our division of the plays into numbered Acts and
Seenes dates only from the Renaissance editions, and though useful for ,
purposes of reference should not have any prominence assigned to it. In
the ancient recensions the only division was that indicated by the scene-
headings. These were written as a rule in two lines, the name of the
speaker in the first and his ‘role' in the second, eg.

ERGASILVS
PARASITVS.

In a very early archetype of the ‘Palatine' recension the first lines of
these scene—headings had been lost, though they were in most cases
supplied by conjecture in a later copy (see Introd. i. ξ 14). That is why
our MSS. here offer only the title of the rffle, PARAsrrvs. Often however
the scene-headings seem to have occupied one line, instead of two, and to
have comprised only the proper names, not the rOles (eg. 111. ii. ⁴2, iii. 2, iv. 2,
v.‘.2‚ IV. iv„ v. i.‚ iii„ iv.).

Ergasilus, the parasite ¹, comes on the stage, looking very lean and woe-
begone (cf. vv, 91 sqq.‚ 133 sqq), and laments the absence of his young
patron Philopolemus, with its attendant inconveniences for himself.

This opening scene curiously resembles that of the Menaechmi, whose
prologue too, as already mentioned (p. 115), with its laboured explanation
of a somewhat intricate plot, reminds us of the prologue to the Captivi.
The parasite in the Menaechmi begins like Ergasilus, with an avowal of
his nickname:

quentus nomen fecit Peniculo mihi,
Ideo quia mensam, quando edo, detergeo,

and goes on to suggest that the most binding fetters for a prisoner in the
⁴ ergastulum' would be a good dinner:

Esca atque potione uinciri decet.
Apud mensam plenam homini rostri deliges.

He mentions the bounty of the ‘adulescens’ Menaechmus <as Ergasilus
praiscs Philopolemus), to which however he has recently been a stranger:
