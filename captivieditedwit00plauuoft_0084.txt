60 INTRODUCTION.

The Versus Reizianus, for example, a characteristic type in
Roman Comedy, used in continuous passages by Plautus (ξ 49),
is found in Aristophanes Pam¹ 954 and elsewhere:

φυσῶντι καὶ πονουμένῳ ΙΙ προσδώσετε δήπου.
The curious couplet at the opening of the Persa:

Qui amans egens ingressus est princeps in Amoris uias
superauit aerumnis is suis aerumnas Herculi,
appears in Lysistr. 299—301 rlzc. τ
κᾶστιν γε Λήμνιον τὸ πῦρ τοῦτο πάσῃ μηχανῇ.
οὗ ’γὰρ ἄν ποθ’ ὧδ’ ὀδὰξ ἔβρυκε τὰς λήμας ἐμοῦ.
The ‘Versus Diphilius' (έυψ-ἰυυέ-Ξ-ἱυυέυυ->, e.g. Aris-
toph. Pam 775 :
Μοῦσα σὺ μὲν πολέμους ἀπωσαμένη μετ’ ἐμοῦ,
has been recognised in Cure. 96-—7 :

flos ueteris uini meis naribus obiectust.
eius amor cupidam me huc prolicit per tenebras,

and in Cas. 644¹ :

iam tibi istuc cerebrum dispercutiam, excetra tu.

(On the curious lines in the Stichus, vv. 11 sqq., which seem to be
modelled upon acephalous Glyconics in combination with the Colon
Reizianum, as in Aristoph. Eq. 1141 sqq., Eccl. 291 sqq„ see ξ 513
on the ‘Choriambo-Trochaics' of Bacch. 1v. iii. see ἓ 42.)

 

4. But a large number of features of the Greek Dramatic ¹
metres are inevitably absent from the Latin. The old associations
of various metres must have been lost. Anapaests could no longer
be recognized by a Roman audience as the metre appropriate to a
march (ξ 25), nor Cretics as the conventional form of a hymn to
Apollo. syncope, οι· the suppression (ie. merging in a neighbouring
long syllable) of a short thesis, is hardly to be looked for in the
Iambic and Troe-haic parts of Plautus' Cantica; and though this or
that special type of syncopated verse, Which had become popular
on the Alexandrian stage, may be reproduced by him, its true
nature was probably not recognized. The opening line of the
Pers-a, quoted above, was to Plautus probably an Iambic Dimeter
Acatalectic (qui Jmmins, essens iusso·c'³s.s¹us est) followed by a Trochaic

² The Casina was an adaptation of the Glurmnenoe of Diphilus (Cas. prol. 32).
