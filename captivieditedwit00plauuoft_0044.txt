22 INTRODUCTION.

words that the colloquial pronunciation was allowed to pass current
even in the higher poetry, eg. prorsus for prover-sus, ditiae¹‚ ditior
and ditissimus for divitior and divitissimus, sis for si vis, audisti
(cf. sisti Mil. 1072 for sivisti) and the like for audivisti, dte. In
Plautus we find also obliscor (cf. class. oblitus) for obliviscor:
Mil. 1359 muliebres mores discendi, obliscendi strati6tici
(cf. Accius Tray. 190, 488);
dinus for diuinus ι
Epid. 316 <Ut> dum rem dinam² faceret, cantaret sibi
(MSS. Ξ P), cf. V. 4193

controrsia for controuersia :

Men. 593 Afit plus aut minus quam opus erat dicto dixeram
controrsiam (ΑΡ).

These shew us suppression of v in the same circumstances as in
di(vi)ti0r, si<ui)s, audi(vi)sti‚ aucli<ui)t, 29r5(v0)rsus, viz. between
ῖ-ί, ὄ-ὀ. Terence has the contracted Positive dis for dives (Α d. 770 3
cf. Bacch. 331 2). In amiculus, the Plautine form3 and, as we see from
the Romance languages (Fr. oncle, &c.)‚ the colloquial form at a later
time also, we seem to have the same suppression of intervocalic v
before the accented syllable, as shews itself in Vulg. Lat. Nomnbris,
‘noi-cius for Novembris, novicius (see Latin Lanquaye, ch. ii. ἓ 53).

Whether we should accept other alleged cases of the suppression of v, under
circumstances for which we have not satisfactory parallels‚ is doubtful. Is the

monosyllabic pronunciation of maturis sufficiently established by the consensus of
ΑΡ in Men. 344:

Nunc in Istoc portu stat navis praedatoria,

or should the line be emended? Cf. Bac-ch. 797 Bene nauis agitatur, pulcre
hacc confertur ratis (agitur edd), and perhaps Enn. Tragy. 73 R. The MSS.
strongly support disyllabic uiuendi in Terence, Andr. 52 :

Liberius uiuendi fuit potestas, narn antea,

bnt editors arc suspicions of so curicus a form.

Other still less certain examples are: cla(ua)t0r Rud. 804, ui(ufi)mus Stich.
(395 (AP3 bibimus edd), «3ιο.

¹ The v-form is not found in Terence, but is the prevalent form in Plautus.
This is truc of other instances where v is suppressed (ἓ 32).

² Icus ιΙνίηιι occurs on 00 inscription of Plautus' time (C.I.L. xi. 4766> nasei
quo «lie ‘res ‹leina (nium flet, ‘nisi qno die res divina annua fiet.’ (For fuller
details see Buecheler in lfheiuiselws Mus-eum, xxxv. 627, Leo ibid. xxxviii. 2.)

³ O-ss· Aul. 79⁴.) Ma* 're repudiant remisit (ninculus οπως-(ἶ ¹mest.
Only once, Aul. prol. 35 Is adulescentis 'illius est ammonius (MSS.=P)‚ do we find
the sour-syllabled pronunciation which alono is tolcrated by a poet like Virgil
(ez avom-ulus claritat Hector). Its occurrence, if the reading be right (Some

read 3³⁵² illius furunculus), and if the prologuc be written by Plautus, may be
cxplnmcd l1ke periculum beside perit-lum «(10. (supr., ἓ 4).
