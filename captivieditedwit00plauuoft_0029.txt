Ι. THE MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. 7

which seems to have been written in Capita] script, and therefore
1ο have dated from not later than the 5th century. Our manuscript
evidence 101· 1116 text 01 Plautus thus resolves 113611 11110 two ancient
MSS. in Capital script (with K for H), one preserved in part (A),
the other lost (ΡΑ).

13. We have indications that PA shared 111 many respects the
outward form 01 A. In A there are 19 lines to the page throughout
the plays. In PA the number seems to have varied between 19
(Epidicus), 20 (Casina, liudem), and 21 (Mostellaria). (866 Seyffert
in Bursian's ‹salto-esbericlnt, lxxx. 236, 1895.) In A the Cantica are
arranged according to the Alexandrian method 01 Colometry, like that
described in Heliodorus’ notes to Aristophanes (ed. Thiemann, Halle,
1869), the longest lines beginning at the extreme left-hand margin
of the page (ἐν ἐκθέσει), 1116 311011631 nearer the middle 01 1116 page
(ἐν εἶσθέσει). If We examine the lacunae in our minuscule MSS.
that are due to holes in 13116 leaves of PA and observe what parts 01
1116 111163 have been absorbed by the same 11016 011 the recto and
verso pages ο1 1116 leaf, we find the same arrangement suggested.
In Cas. 771, for example, an Iambic Senarius which stood on the
verso page,

Sed nimium lepide dissimulant, quasi nihil sciant,

the words quasi nihil sciam have been cut off. The corresponding
line on the recto page seems to be v. 751, a short line 01 a
Canticum,

Gladium Casinam intus habere ait.

Only the first word, stadium, has disappeared; so that this line
could not have begun at the extreme left-hand margin, but must
have occupied about the same position in the page of PA as it does
in the page 01 A.

But although the method 01 indicating the division of ‘lines'
(properly cola) was probably identical in A and ΡΛ, 111616 are clear
instances that these two early Μ88. 011611 adopted different divisions
01 a Canticum into lines, so that 111 11113 respect, as 111 30 many others,
A and PA represent two different early editions or ί166611310113ὀ1
1116 plays (see iii. ξ 5).

14. The Scene-headings in A and PA seem to have been 01
similar form, the proper names being stated in the first line, the
