76 INTRODUCTION.

In Plautus we find Trochees similarly used, eg. in Aul. 406 sqq. (where the
cook hurries out of the house) :

attatae ciues, populares, incolae, accolae, aduenae omnes,
date uiam qua fugere liceat, facite totae plateae pateant,

although Anapaests often play this part, e.g. in the excited utterances of the
miser Euclio over the loss of his hoard, Aul. 713 sqq. :

perii, interii, occidi, quo curram? quo nbn curram? tene, tene, quem?
quis? Sec.

But extreme agitation and the excit-ed change of mood are best indicated by
alternation of Iambic and Trochaic Verse (ξ 13).

O. Anapaestie. (See Audouin, dc Plautinis Αἠαραεεεὶε, Paris,
1898.)

20. In the Anapaestic lines of the Greek Oomedians the spondee
(- -—'-)‚ dactyl (—6 υ), and occasionally the proceleusmatic (υυύυ)
(eg. Aristoph. Nub. 916 διὰ σὲ δὲ φοιτᾶν οὐδεὶς ἐθέλει) are admitted
along with the anapaest (o υ 4). The same substitutes are recognized
by Plautus. In the second part of the ‘metrum¹' the Greeks do not
tolerate a dactyl unless the first part also is composed of a dactyl. Of
this rule too we find at least a partia] recognition (but of. Pers. 781,
quoted in g 22) in Plautus. (Fuller details in Klotz, pp. 281 sqq.)

21. But while Diaeresis is required in Greek at the end of the
hemistich 2, and is often found at the end of each individua] ‘metrum‚'
it is not affected by Plautus to the same extent (eg. Pers. 778, 782,
quoted in ἓ 22, Stich. 22, 24, 25, 30, 35, 315, 317, quoted in §23).
To follow the Greek practice closely would bring the metrical ictus
into constant clash with the natural accent, a thing alien to the
spirit of Latin verse (see Appendix), so that Latin Anapaests should
be constructed on different principles. From a sentence of Marius
Victorinus (iii. p. 77 Κ.) it appears that Pacuvius was the poet
whose name was associated With a reformed type of Anapaests which
better suited the genius of the Latin language. The lines quoted

from him (Tray. 350 R.) :
Agite, ite, euoluite, rdpite, coma
Tractate per aspera saxa et humum,

¹ In the Anapaestic, as in the lambio and Trochaic Matres, two feet are
required for the ‘metrum' or metrical unit of the line. Hence a Dimeter is
composed of four ‘f(*et,’ a Tetranicter of eight ‘feet.’

² Thougll the Greek Comedians occasionully dispenso with it, eg. Aristoph.
Vesp. 568 κᾶν μὴ τούτοις ἁναπειθώμεσΙΙθα, τὰ παιδάρι’ εὐθὺς ἀνέλκει. We may
illustrate the normal Diaei-esis froin our own accentual Anapaests: ‘Over hill,
over dale, thorough bush, thorough brier,’ dac.
