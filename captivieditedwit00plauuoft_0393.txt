7. Apocopated words form an exception to the rule that the Latin
aecent (unlike the Greek) never falls on the final syllable. The Latin
Grammarians quote as examples such words as ι’ἰίῗο for ilar-ow), ταηίὸη for
tant5-n(e)‚ Pyrrhia for Pyrrhi-nm). That this pronunciation was departed
from under special circumstances we see from the remark of Servius
(ad Aen. vi. 779) that viden (i.e. vides-72(e)) was the actual pronunciation
of his time. Plautus too scans vide'n as he often scans vides, and similarly
in other cases of elided -qu(e), -n(e). Thus we find prosper-&quw (Amph. 463 ;
cf. Pseud. 574), as we find prospere on occasion. The normal incidenee
of ictus on such word-groups is the same as that on the single word,
surricptasquoe) like surraptas, δῖα, and may quite well reflect the actual
pronunciation (for details see Ahlberg in Lund Dissertations, 1897, p. 31).
The classica] scansion of Neuter Adjectives which have lost final -e and
become Nouus, eg. calcdv', animal, bacchanal, shews that this rule of the
Grammarians had not been observed in their case either. But the inter-
mediate stage between, e.g. bacolzancfle and ὂασοῆᾱηᾶἰ, must have been

baccham'il ; and the word appears with this quantity and this ictus in
Aul. 411:

attat perii hercle ego miser: aperitur bacchanffl3 adest.

The different incidence of ictus in ῖῖῖῑ and illie, both of which were in the
time of Plautus used either as the Adverb ‘there' or as Dative of the
Pronoun ‘to him‚’ has been obscurcd by the scribes of the MSS. of Plautus,

who have usually changed illi Adv. to the classical illic, and illic Dat. to
the classica] illi, eg. capt. 278:

quod genus ilci est unum pollens atque honoratissurmmn

where the MSS. offer illic, the elassical form, but where the metre requires
illi. That Plautus used hoff-nnc, hamme (with this incidence of ictus) but
labrum, fuirum before a word beginning with a consonant is certain (see
Studemund, Jahrb. Phil. cxiii. p. 57), though this usage too is often
obseured by the MSS. In Pseud. 69, for example, lzarz‘mw uolzlptdtmm the
Ambrosian Palirnpsest alone has preserved the true reading Icarum, while
the Palatine MSS. have altered it to the more familiar harum. The normal
ictus quid ‘53th or quid ism, quid Istuc 01· quid ἷείῖὶσ, agrees with what the
Grammarians tell us of the strong stress on the Interrogative and of the
oxytone nature of istic, isnin· (for ismiel-ce).

Seyffert (in Berl. Philon. WochenschrIJt‚ xviii. 1577) states that potin, viden,
abin, etc„ are never found to represent an iambus at the end of a line or hemi—
stich in Plautus (ef. Intr. ii. ξ 3).

Ι fancy that the common incidenee of ictus on the final syllable of a
word (or phrase) uttered in a tone of strong surprise or indignation reflects
