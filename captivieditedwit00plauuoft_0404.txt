of Donatus on the pronunciation of words in some lines of Terence, eg. si
quamdo, interea loci, but from the express statement of Aulus Gellius
(second century A.D.>, who mentions an appeal to a line of Plautus, ending
ciliorum affatim est, for the accentuation (ffatim, and to a line of Terence,
ending ex-a‘dversffim loco, for the accentuation exadversum (the usual
accentuation of his own time being qffdtz‘m, exadversum), and quotes the
testimony of a pupi] of Valerius Probus that that celebrated Grammarian
(of Nero's time) read the line of Plautus with that pronunciation of the
word.
