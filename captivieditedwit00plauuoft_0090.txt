66 INTRoDUC'rioN.

The Roman imitators of the New Comedy continue these con-
cessions to resolved feet, and extend them by admitting the dactyl
into the ‘even' feet 1300. But at no period of Greek Dramatic
Poetry is the iambic rhythm of the line sacrificed by the admission
of spondees into the second or fourth feeff. On the transference of
the metre to Roman soil however this barrier is broken down.
Plautus admits spondees into all feet (except of course the last).

Caesius Bassus (ap. Rufin. Matr. Terent. 556 K), the friend and teacher of
Persius, severely criticized that line of Terence which Horace was able to turn,
with slight alteration, into a dactylic hexameter (Sat. 11. iii. 264; cf. Persius

v. 161), viz. Eun. 49:
exclusit : reuocat : redeam? non, si me obsecret.
Thus the second foot is composed of a spondee (multa) in such a
line as :—

uin commutemus? tuam ego ducam et tu meam?

A spondee-word or word—ending, however, such as would involve
marked discrepancy of metrical ictus from the natural accent, is
not favoured. Thus a line is not very frequently found of such a
form as:

uin commutem? uin tuam ego ducam 613 tii meam?

where the ‘irrational' thesis is the accented syllable of the word.
On the regularity of Caesura in Latin Iambic Verse see ἓ 6.

The caesura in the Senarius usually follows the first thesis of

the second metrum and is sometimes ‘latent' caesura, eg. Prin.

759:
Potin est ab amic(0) alicunde exorari? Potest.

(For fuller details see Klotz, Grundzz‘eye, pp. 187 sqq.)

Here are some examples of this unusual type of spondee :—

Tr1'n. 410 Quam si tu obicias formicis papauerem (ΑΡ, Charisius 83:
Quam si formicis obicias papauerem Nonius 220).

Cure. 371 Beatus uideor: subduxi ratiunculam.

Capt. 192 Ibo intro atque intus subducam ratiunculam.

They are usually due to the necessity of getting polysyllabic words into the line.
A fuller list is given by Klotz, Grmvdziiqe, pp. 325 sqq„ from which it appears
that a form like seilffi11cld,{t‹7 ‹rm-sei is less avoided than a form like fz'ericis. The

1 lambio, like Trochaic and Anapaestie Meti-e, was scanned by Dipodies, not
by single feet. The chief metrical ictus of the line, in other words the syllables
at which the baton of a conductor keeping time would fall, were in an Iambic
Trimeter the 2nd, 4th and ssth Arses (in a Trochaic Tetrameter the lst, 3rd,
5th and 7th). Hence the necessity of exhibiting the metre in its pure form at
hese parts of the line (Bassus ap. Rufin. 555 K. ; Terent. 2246 sqq. Κ.).
