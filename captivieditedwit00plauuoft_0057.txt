11. PRosoDY. 35

Here, too, the shortening of a vowel naturally long is so rare
as to excite suspicion. The most clearly attested shortenings are
of ἑ (ἔω, ἔο-) and ῐι (db), eg. tibi-euenit (Merc. 7745 cf. be'ne-
e⁹uenisse Poen. 1078), quid ἄ nobis metuit? Capta. 206.

For other examples see Skutsch in Satura Viadrina, Breslau 1896. For
statistics of the scansion of trisyllabic words like voluptas, molestae δια, see
Esch (mentioned above). The ‘brevis brevians' need not be a monosyllable
(naturally or by elision); cf. *ipsus illic Mil. 1388, inter {stas Poen. 265. (For
other examples see Skutsch, Forschungyen, i. p. 98.) Priscian’s citation (i. p. 17,
2) of sine wamia (Ter. Andr. 66) as an example of the suppression of υ, like
the loss of the Greek Digamma, must not be construed into a theory of this
scansion. He is merely seeking a parallel from Latin poetry which will

illustrate to Roman students of Homer how a vowel followed by a consonant
and v might be capable of short scansion.

Other polysyllabic groups have more resemblance to iambic
words 2——

22. (4) Monosyllabic words joined in utterance into a word—group
with a single accent. A phrase like quis huc currit? would have
the accentuation of a phrase consisting of an iambic word followed by
currit (see Appemlix), quis-ltuc—czlrrz't like ‘miser ezir-rit. NVhether the
accent on the first monosyllable or the accent on the longer word
would be the more forcible depended on the nature and nuance of
the phrase. In such word-groups a long (even long by nature)
monosyllabic subordinate or enclitic word, eg. stuc, haec, is frequently
shortened under the Law of Breves Breviantes, eg. quis kch ezzo-ric 2¹,
quis Ῐιαέσ dat-it ?‚ quod hic t(e) crat Poen. 1024, ut ltcte'c invenirincur
Poen. 117 1.

Sometimes the short preceding syllable is composed not of a monosyllabic
word but of an elided disyllabus, eg. Bacch. 491 εἰὶὸ(ῐ). Sometimes the sub-
ordinate word is an elided disyllable, eg. het-0103), Aul. 831 uel hercle e'n‘z'ca.
Sometimes the word-group is as capable of being classed with the instances
given in ἓ 21, eg. cripe &cc-ore Stich. 718. (Other examples in Skutsch, Forsch-
unqen, i. p. 93 n.)

23. The requirements for the shortening of a syllable in Plautus
are therefore (l) a preceding short syllable, (2) accent on a neighbour-

ing syllable, whether on the following or on the (short) preceding.
Are these requirements ever dispensecl with?

Certainly a syllable which bore the accent² in the pronunciation

¹ The Roman Grammarians tell us that the Interrogative Pronoun was
aceented, the Relative unaccented. (Lat. Lany. ch. iii. ξ, 12 α.)

² We must distinguish between word-aecem, i.e. the accent which a word
would have if it were mentioned alone, and ‘sentence-accent,’ i.e. the accent
