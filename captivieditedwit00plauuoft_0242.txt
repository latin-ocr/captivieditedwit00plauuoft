or <αὸ> animo. And an editor of Plautus is often confronted with the
difficulty of deciding whether a Preposition has been wrongly repeated by
one MS. or Wrongly omitted by another, eg. :

Mil. 607 Se'd speculabor nequis aut hinc aut ab laeua aut [a] dextera
(a APCD, om. B),

where the retention of α involves the scansion nequis (see Introd. ii. ξ 13).

In Rud. 29 the repeated Prepesition is omitted by B, but retained
CD .

by P ι Quique aetatem agitis cum pietate et cum fide,

while in Poen. 293 (where it is not required by the meti-e) it is omitted by
PCD but retained by B and A :

Curram igitur aliquo ad piscinam aut ad lacum, limum petam,
and in Eud. 1170, a line quoted by Priscian, it is omitted by O and by the
MSS. of Priscian, but retained by B and D:

A. Sucula. B. Quin tu i dierecta cum sucula et cum porculis.

A scribe would, Ι fancy, be more liable to omit a Prepesition when it was
repeated than to insert a Prepesition when it did not stand in his original;
and in this line the liability would be increased by the neighbouring Inter
me atque illum. Still the fact remains that the second ad apparently did
not stand in the original of our MSS. and is required neither by the metre
nor by the grammatical usage of Plautus.

Rota. Some understand ‘hoop’ (trochus of Hor. (Ὗ. 111. xxiv. 57:
Graeco seu iubeas trocho Ludere), others ‘potter’s wheel' (rota fiyulam's of
Epzfd. 371 uorsutior es quam rota fiyzclarz's). But the wheel of a carriage
may equally be referred to. There is the same difficulty about rotula in

Pers. 443:
Mirum, qum citius iam a foro argentarii

Abeunt, quam in cursu rotula circumumtitur.

371. Cf. V. 199 and (Je'st. 741 ta (tua MSS.) cibi wmc prodes. Tute
tibi seems in the dialogue of Plautus to have the ictus Μεθ’ tibi, and was
probably pronounced like a four-syllabled word with accent on the second
syllable, ο.ξς. Cure. 9 Tute tz'bz' puer es, lautus luces cereum (with luceo in its
old Causative sense). The retention of ea (Neut. PL), which is hardly
possible from gramlnatical reasons (cf. Tria. 35 id qnod prosint pluribus),
would require the unlikely scansion Tat(e) timi) ecc (see note on following
linc). Tute is separated from tibi in Pseud. 20 Cape scas tabellas, tute hinc
