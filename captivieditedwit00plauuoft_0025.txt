Ι. ΤΗΕ MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. 3

divided into two volumes, the second of which contained the last
twelve plays. This second volume, presumably owing to a defective
title-page, fell into such neglect that at the Renaissance only
the first eight plays were known, and the discovery of a MS.

which contained the last twelve was hailed as the discovery of a
lost classic,

5. The last twelve plays are found in three MSS. 2-—

(B) the Codex Vetus (containing also the first eight plays 3 see
below). This is a MS. which belonged originally to some German
monastery and in later times to the Library of the Elector Palatine.
It is now in the Vatican Library (with shelf-mark Pal. lat. 1615).
Its minuscule script of the German type is generally referred to the
end of the tenth century. The last seven plays (Pseud, Poen„ Pers„
Eud„ Stich„ Tria„ Truc.) were divided between several scribes, to
each of whom was assigned only a small portion to copy, with the
happy result that in these plays we have an extremely faithful re-
production of the original, even without a eorrector's aid. Cor=
rections are frequent in the earlier plays (Bac-cla„ Most„ splen„ to
the middle of the sssiles) and retrieve the numerous errors of the
scribes, But for the latter half of the Asilas and nearly the whole
of the Mercator (to v. 1012) Β cannot be regarded as so faithful a

copy of its original. That original we must assume to have been P
itself‚ unless we can believe that these already-mentioned misw ritings

of so common words as haec, huic could have remained uncorrected
through more stages of transcription.

Assuming P to have been the immediate original of Β, we can shew the
number of lines to the page of P to have been 33. For the excessive con-
scientiousness of the German monk who copied in B a part of the Poenulus led
him to copy the very headings of the page of his original at the place where they
stood in the original! So that in the margin at vv. l222-3 we find plauti, at
vv. 1255-(3 paenam-5, at vv. 1288-5) plauti, and again at vv. 1354—5 plauti,
at v. 1385 penquS‚—-sure indicatione· that the Poenulus in the original of B
was written on peges of some 33 lines. The transposition of two long passages
of the same play, each of 6ss lines (vv. 218—284, which follow v. 352, and
vv. 480-546, which follow v. (303), is the result of two broadsheets of the
original, the second and the third broadsheet of a quatmnion, having changed
places. The second broadsheet, that is the second and seventh leaves, contained
on leaf ii vv. 218—284, and on leaf vii vv. 547—608. The third, that is the
third and sixth leaves5 contained on leaf iii vv. 285—352, and on leaf vi vv. 480
-546. Each leaf thus held 66 lines, each page 33. That this number of lines
1ο a page persistet] through the other plays is of itself the most natural suppo-
sition and receives some confirmation from an old quaternion-mark, barely
