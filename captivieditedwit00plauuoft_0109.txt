111. METRE. 83

28. The most common of these substitutes is the molossus. The
use of a molossus (—-'-ss) for a bacchius (ossss) is, like the use of
a spondee for an iambus (g 7), restricted by considerations of the
accentuation of the word. At the end of the line or hemistich (1.6.
111 1116 second or fourth foot of the Tetrameter) a molossus, which
would involve too great a confliet of the metrica] ictus and the accent
of pronunciation, is avoided. For example, in the passages from
the Amphitruo and Mercator quoted above, the molossi in ‘even'
feet in Amph. 560 (deflerre're', Mero. 345 (incerfli ce'rtdnt, 350 ἒ83(6>
{llo-cm, 353 ᾶςρόνίέι, 356 inuitam, 357 Ξηαὲηῐ, &a exhibit under
metrical ictus the same syllable as receives the stress of the voice in
pronunciation. The ‘irrational' thesis is not formed by a syllable
on which the chief stress of the voice falls. In the first foot of
Amph. 567, uidit nec, we find a clash of the metrica] ictus uidit
and the natural accent uidit 3 the ‘irrational' thesis ui· is the
stress—syllable. It is especially in the first foot that a thesis of this
kind is tolerated, but it is found also in the third.

29. With all these possible substitutes for the bacchius the
metre is often in danger of being obseured. Thus in the passages
quoted above, Mero. 350 has a bacchius only in the second foot,
Alere. 351 only in the fourth foot, but molossi in the rest. But
Plautus seems to have required that each Bacchiae line should
eontain at least 0116 foot with proper short thesis, whether a
bacchius (υ--), 01· a fourth paeon (ovo-Q or a second paeon
(υ-υυ). However, though this is the only law which will cover
all Bacchiae lines in Plautus, it must be remembered that the pure
bacchius is the predominant foot, and that the Bacchiae character
of a passage is generally well marked, even though an occasional
line shews a large intrusion of the other feet which are allowed as
substituteS.

Doubt therefore attaches to 1116 correctness of the text or of the Bacchiae
treatment of lines like:

Poen. 218 postquam afirora inluxit, numquam concessamus (un-Plautine?).

Truc. 566 haec eum uideo fieri, suffiiror, suppilo (rather Anapaestie).

Truc. 95 ad 16166 auscultate l atque adseruate aedis (see ξ 35).

Titinius 103 R. nunc hoc uror, nl'me haec res me facit festinem (Anap.).

We have thus a criterion for distinguishing a Colon Reizianum from a
‘ contracted ' Bacchiae Dimeter (ξ 33). For example, in the Casina (vv. 842—3)
we have a Bacchiae Tetrameter followed by the short line :

corpusculum malaeum.

This cannot be scanned as a Bacchiae ‘contracted' Dimeter‚ for the Bacchiae
nature of --Ι ννννν is unreeognizable. It. must be a Colon Reizianum.
