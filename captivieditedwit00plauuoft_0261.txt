seems to be most simply restored by Niemeyer's insertion of tum, since
Bothe's cupiit is an abnormal form in Plautus, and esse <se> cupit
(cf. Most. 61 Nisi te mala re magna mactari cupis) is unlikely.

464. Nam, ‘I say this fel-‚² as in v, 478 (where see note). Die.
The Dat. Sg. ending of the F ifth Decl. was monosyllabic in Early Latin
and probably in Classical Latin too, until the disyllabic Genitive ending
came to be substituted for it (νὲῑ Lucr. i. 687, ii. 235, «νὲῖς Hor. C. iii.
24. 64). But that this monosyllabic ending had invariably the form -ἑ
(fide Hor. S. i. 3. 95) is doubtful. There may have been also -ῖ (in archaic

spelling ἐξ). We know from Aulus Gellius <second century A.D.) how
persistently the scribes of the Empire effaced from their copies the antique
forms of their originals; and in one chapter of the Noctes Atticae (ix. 14)
he mentions two actual examples of the modernising of Fifth Declension
forms (ξ 2 corruptos autem quosdam libros repperi in quibus ‘faciei'
scriptum est, illo, qaod ante scriptum erat, oblitterato, and again ξ 3), So
that the form offered by our MSS. in this line, diei, may well have been
suhstituted for an older (lie and not retain the archaic spelling of the other
hypothetic ending in -ῖ, The disyllabic -ez' of the Fifth Decl.‚ like the
disyllabic -αί of the First Decl.‚ is in Plautus a Genitive, never a Datim,
ending (sce Cla-ss. Rev. x. 424). Ergasilus afterwards forms a vastly
different opinion about the day (v. 774 Ita hic me amoenitate amoena
amoenus· oozeram't (lies).

466. Ieiuniosiorem‚ sc, diem. This unusual Adjective is formed from
jejunia, as inopiosas Poen. 130 fron] inopia, &c chertum fame,
like inaniis oppletae (aedes) Aul. 84. On the spelling of the proposition
see note on v. 457.

467. occeperit. There is no need to write occeperim or occepeods.
The day itself is humorously made the chief ligure throughout the
passage. ⁵

468. Ita. Some retain itaque of the MSS„ giving it the pronunciation
