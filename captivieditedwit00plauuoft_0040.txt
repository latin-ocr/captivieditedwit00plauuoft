18 INTRODUCTION.

But -ιῖ in Nom. Sing. of 1 Deol. and Nom. Ace. Plur. of Neuter Nouns is
unknown to Plautus and Terence, even in loan-words from the Greek, so that
the scansions familia (Trin. 251), epistula (Asin. 762), libera (Epid. 498 ; cf. ἓ 34),
and even Samia (Eun. 107), Sosia (Amph. 439), must be abandoned. In the
Vocative of Greek Names like Sosius, Leonidas the long α seems to be found, e.g.
Leonida} (Asin. 740), if the reading of the MSS. be correct. In the Abl. Sing. of
the 3 Decl.‚ where a long final vowel is required by the metre, we should change
-e of the MSS. to -i3 for -ἑ and i appear to have been the Ablative forms in use
in Plautus' time, never -ἑ, The few apparent examples of -ἑ in the Infinitive
(Lat. Lany. viii. ξ 85) are probably illusory (see ἓ 34). The Abl. Plur. in -bz'ts,
apparently offered by the MSS. in some passages (cf. ἓ 34), is certainly impossible.
In the First Decl. the ending -as is not found in the Nom. Plur. (in Trin. 539
alternas Adv. or alternis Adv. should be read) nor (with the exception of the
legal form familias in the phrases pater familias, διο.) 111 the Gen. Sing. The
old Gen. Sing. ending -ᾶὶ is found along with its classica] shortened form —ae.
Notice that -ae Gen. is perhaps never elided, while elision of -ae Dat„ -ae Nom.
Plur. (and -ae Loc. Sing.) is frequent (Leo Plaut. Forsch. 3122 criticised by
Skutsch in Jalzresber. Roman. th'lol. iv. 84). (For details on these endings see

Lat. Lany. eh. vi.)

6. Vowel preceding vowel in same word.. That a long
vowel or diphthong before another vowel tended to be shortened
in Latin We see from forms like prehendo for prae-hendo, dc‘erro
for cle-erro. How far the forins sanctioned by the Augustan
poets tallied with those of current pronunciation and with those
admitted into the earlier poetry, is not easy to discover. Servius
(ad Virg. Aen. i. 451) says that audiit, leniit were the forms of
current usage. Quintilian (1. v, 18) declares unius to be the only
form of the Genitive in actual use (‘unius'...extra carmen non
deprendas). The scansions illius, istius dac. are usually denied for

ι, Plautus, although his usual practice with originally long vowels that
precede other vowels seems to be to admit both the long and the
short quantity (but only platea, balineae, dte).

In Plautus we find occasionally such scansions as z

(a) -Zz', -Zero, eg. lero Capt. 194 (q. v.)‚ {crant Ad. 27, audieras
Phorm. 573, (audierit Hec. 813. {erant is attested by Donatus in his
note on 'l‘orenco Ad. 27 (1. i. 2) : producte i pronuntiando, quod nos
addita v ‘ iverant ' (licinius,

(b) -τῖὶ 111 the Perfect of Verbs in -uo, eg. institui Most. 86,
pest-plaic Most. 164, pluerat Men. 63, fait Pers. 168‚fazisse Bacch. 5.

Tho statvmont of C. F. Miillcr (Nachtriiffe, p. 84) that fni, svm are only
allowed at tho end os the lino 01· hemistich‚ is incorreet (see Seyffert in Berliner
l'lailnlnsyistthu U'aalzensclu-{fa xviii. 1557). Adsum-0 (or adimo, Lat. Lcmy. viii.
48) for ‹ulia-mero (cf. Most. (391) occurs in Phorm- 537:

sim-i misorum. qui mc dudum, ut dixti, adiuerit comiter,
