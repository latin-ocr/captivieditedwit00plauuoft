11. PaosoDY. 25

that tendency to suppress one of two similar neighbouring syllables, that we see
in words like voluntas for volumi-tax, Restutus for Restitutus, (icc. ‘ Illic’st' for
illic est (Truo. 121) would favour the first hypothesis3 but the scansion is
doubtful. While -ᾰε est became -ust, -ἳε est became -est (Leo, p. 2583 cf. ad

Gapt. 518).

13. Shortening of long monosyllables joined. to ‘quidem.'
In the Augustan poetry siquidem (e. g. Truc. 875) is admitted, but
in Plautus we have other combinations which exhibit the same
curicus phonetic change, mquidem beside tzZ quidem, tequidem and
me'quidem beside ιέ quidem and me quidem (cf. si quidem, eg. Mil.

28).

How it is to be explained is uncertain, though it seems to resemble the
shortening of words like ‘sheep‚’ ‘know’ in ‘shepherd,' ‘knowledge‚' and of the
first syllable of ‘nation' in ‘national‚’ a shortening due to the recession of the
accent. Luchs, Commeat. Prosodiacae, shews that quidem is an enclitic ap-
pendage of Pronouns, and that Plautus’ normal accentuation is estquidam,
έιῖραίάενη, διο. Nor is it certain how fai· the rule may be extended. Siquis,
siquid are generally accepted by-forms of εἰ quis, si quid (for details see Skutsch
Forsch. i. 9 n„ Leo, de Vidularia, p. 5), eg. Ter. Andr. 258, Stich. 182, Aul. 340:

quod si ego rescissem id prius quid facerem siquis nunc me roget.
nulli negare soleo siquis me essum uocat (P, om. me A).
turba istic nulla tibi erit: siquid uti uoles,

though some would remove them in various ways, e.g. by substitution of siqui
(cf. Ter. Ad. 521, where si qui and si quid are variants of the MSS.); cf. iii.§ 7.
And hicqui'dem (hiquidem) with short first syllable >is tho normal scansion,
e.g. Capt. 823. (For details see Luchs, Gommnt. Prosocliacae, who adds that
illequidem and istequiclcm are the only forms in use, not ‘illicquidem,’ ‘istic-
quidem,' a fact which suggests hiquidem as the real form employed; cf. Seyffert
in Berl. Philol. Wochenschr'ift, xviii. 978, and on {dqwidem Seyffert, ibid. 1890,
p. 309). Quandtquidem is a classical Latin scansion, in which the word preceding
quidem is not a monosyllable, as in these other examples. Qustquidem seems to
occur in Poen. 1213 z

Sed quis homost? Amicus uobis. Qui quidem inimicus 11011 siet

(cf. Ad. 268). If we allow siqni'S, siquid, it is difficult to refuse acceptance of
nequis, nequid. We seem to have pyrrich scansion of quidquid in Trin. 218:

und(e) quidquid auditum dicant, nisi id appareat (hardly -qm‘d mmmmm iii. ξ 7),

of ecquis (equis) in Bacch. 583 and many other lines (see Klotz, (r'rundziigye,
p. 46). Some scan namquid in Mero. 282, sicine in Pers. 42, and so on (cf. iii.
ἓ 7). It is this principle of shortening which semns to explain 9111731· beside
quam si, hffilie for h6(c)-die, but whether this explanation legitimizes a by-form
hodie in Plautus (eg. Pseud. 1071) is doubtful. (For suller details see Buecheler
in Archiv lat. Lemikogyraphie iii. 144; Seyffert in Bursian’s Jahresberichz, 1890,
p. 9.) In our present state of knowledge we cau hardly feel perfectly certain
ot any shortening like classica] siquidem, quandoquidem excepting the closely
analogous mequidem, mquidem, tequidem. These three arc quite sufficicntly
guaranteed.
