368 PLAVTI oAPTIVI.

jas-jurandum. They do not even definitely inform us that these enclitic
or subordinate words gained an accent of their own when immediately
followed by another enclitic, that, for example, unde Rel. and quis Indef.
were uttered with a certain stress in phrases like amun-lubet (Epid. 144. On
the monosyllabic pronunciation of unde see Intr. ii. ξ 14), nequis sit drbiter
(the ending of an lambio Senarius, Poen. 178), where they precede the
subordinate verbs lubet (cf. quilubet, qublubet) and sit. And while they
tell us that Interrogatives were accented, they do not say whether the
accent of the Interrogative (as is the likely supposition) or of the Noun
was stronger in a question like quis bric homost ?, which in Plautus always
takes the ictus on the quis and not on the first syllable of the subordinate
word lzomo (see below). It is seldom that they condescend to such minutiae
as the difference of meaning conveyed by the accentuations si quando and
(the usual) si quando, a difference pointed out by Donatus in his note on
Terence Eun. 437:

scin siquando illa mentionem Phaedriae
facit:

‘siquando' et prima syllaba acui potest et media, tamen variat sententiam,
and, no doubt, corresponding to our ‘ff ever,' as compared with ‘if ever!
In the absence of complete information about the accentuation of the
spoken Latin sentence, it would be futile to attempt to compile exact
statistics of the number of lines in which this or that accented word or
syllable has or has not the ictuS, and so it is diffie-ult to demonstrate by
figures the wonderful extent to which agreement of ictus and sentence-
accent prevails in Plautus and Terence. It can be recognized by anyone
who will take the trouble of reading a play or two with his attention
directed to this point.

13. In connexion with Enclitic Particles, the remark of Servius (ad Aen.
vi. 77 9) that videm was the current pronunciation has been already mentioned
(ξ 7) as evidence of a return of the accent of a word to its usual place
when the enclitic appendage was reduced by elision, viden (i.e. vides-72(e))
like vides (in everyday speech vidgs). As dum is an enclitic appendage of
the Imperative, eg. exenta-dum Aul. 646, duceri-dum Most. 679, aspice-dum
Most. 1105, so is sis (from si vis). The normal incidence of ictus in Plautus
is properti-32⁶3, &c., but vide-sis, &c < Seyffert in Berl. sz'lol. Woclzenscltrzft‚
1891, p. 112.) Similarly the normal ictus priwmtmdum (for instances see
Richardson, de ‘dum' particula, p. 13) seems to reflect the accentuation.

14. Spellings like saluost, saluast shew us that there need be no clash
of ictus and accent in a phrase like salui-sumus Asin. 320.

Nor can we find fault with the incidence of ictus in a phrase like
pauper-sum Aul. 88, uictor-sum Pseud. 1036, placitae-sunt Hec. prol. 21.

15. The stressed and unstressed uses of the Latin Persona] Pronoun
have produced two series in the Romance languageS, eg. Italian ‘me,' ‘te’
emphatic, ‘mi,' ‘ti' unemphatic. These unemphatic forms are joined to
the verb, eg. prestate mi il libro, ‘lend me the book.' If something
