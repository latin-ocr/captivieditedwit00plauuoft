11. PROSODY. 21

Dramatists, but excluded by the Augustan poets, many seem at first
sight to be archaisms rather than colloquialisms, because they are
found in other early poets. Disyllabic eodem, for example (ἓ 15),
occurs in Lucilius (and in Lucretius too). But the truth is that
the exclusion of colloquial forms and scansions from the language
of elevated poetry was not fully accomplished till Augustus' time.

¹ The earliest poets took the language as they found it and

applied to it the Greek laws of quantitative metre. A language
with a stress-accent like the Latin did not readily adjust itself
to the quantitative test. Many of its syllables, as pronounced
in ordinary discourse⁷ were not definitely long nor definitely
short, but what modern phoneticians call ‘half-long' syllables.
A word like abest, when pronounced separately and with due
regard to the spelling, would exhibit a second syllable long by
position, but in the conventional utterance of a sentence like non
Zc‘mye abest hoc ab {llo the word would sound as like a pyrrich
as an iambus, Ennius required stricter rules of pronunciation for
the language of elevated poetry than previous poets, and his
strictness was maintained and increased by his poetical successors.
But it took considerable time before poetica] diction attained the
severe regularity that it shews in the hands of the Augustan poets.
Lucilius allows himself to scan abe'st (ix. 29 M.) :

‘r' non multum abest hoc cacosyntheton atque canina

si lingua dicas ‘nihil ad me,'
though Ennius in his Epic restricts this shortening to final vowels,
eg. puto, to the complete (or almost complete) exclusion of, eg. ἰερᾰηι,
and was followed in this restrictiori by his successore (cf. ξ, 18).

But it would be a mistake to reg-ard abest, put& as pronunciations
characteristic of Plautus’ time like curat, terret, audit, (linxit. In
ordinary discourse the words would be so pronounced in the time of
Virgil as in the time of Plautus: but while Plautus admits these
pronunciations of every-day life into his verse, Virgil and the
Augustan poets exclude them. Though, however, they were ex-
cluded from elevated poetry, they were still allowed in Dramatic
composition. Afranius, who belongs to the close of the Republican
period, admits them as frcely as Plautus,
