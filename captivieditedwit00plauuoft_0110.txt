84 INTRODUCTION.

When a line ends with a monosyllabic word, the thesis of the last foot must
be pure. Thus in the passages quoted above we have in Amph. 551 -sequo‘r te,
555 fide‘s sit, 557 tvzo‘s sum, dte. (Other examples in Klotz, Grundzffigye, p. 231.)
This rule is not binding, (1) when the final monosyllable is preceded by
another monosyllable, e.g. emm-usit ab se Merc. 358, (2) when the monosyllable
15 preceded by elision, e.g. scelatwm) it Cure. 118.

30. When the short syllable that forms the thesis of a Bacchiae foot is
replaced by two short syllables, they usually belong to the same word as the
first arsis (Klotz, p. 343). They certainly should not be the final syllable of one
word and the initial syllable of another, for the pause that naturally eomes at
the close of a word unduly extends the time occupied by the two-syllabled thesis
A rare instance of a foot of this kind is the second foot of Poen. 240 :

soror, cogita amabo Ι item nos perhiberi,

where -9ἱῖ(α) ἄνη· constitute the thesis. (For the similar law against the division
between words of the two-syllabled thesis of an anapaest, the substitute for an
iambus, see ξ 9.) When either arsis is resolved into two short syllables, these
are the equivalents of a long, and not a short, syllable3 so the same objection
cannot be made to their division between words. Still division of this kind is
unusual even in the ease of these resolved arseS. The two short syllables
generally belong to the same word. When they do not, they are usually formed
of a monosyllabic (or elided disyllabie) word and the initial syllable of a
disyllabie word. Thus 111 the passages of the Amphitruo and Mercator quoted
above the instances of resolved arsis (indicated by suprascript v) are Amph. 556

promeritus, 571 -prob(c) ἔεὶαῃις Mero. 355 νηίεέήον, 345 iffa) ἆηῑτηῐ, 346 -sili
οἄΡέ-, 347 -ror (immo, 348 consilium, 349 pace'r phtia, 354 -zus ῗῃῐειιν, 357 ib(2·)
ho‘c mdlhcm) ἔμω), 360 muscdst mezi-s. In all of these the two short syllables
are eomprised within a single word with one exception, viz. Mero. 357 2
mercatum ire iussit: ibi hoe walhem) ἔρῃ») inueni,
where both are formed of elided disyllabic words.
Other examples of the separation of the syllables of a resolved arsis are:

cist. 686 nulla est nequ(e) &³90 sum usquam. perdita perdidit me.
Truc. 713 nune dum isti lubet, ἀῑῖηι habet, tempus secundumst (t. ei rei
secundas MSS.).

An incidenee of ictus like perdere, disperdere is avoided in Bacchiae (and
Cretie) as in the ‘dialogue‘ Metrcs (ἓ 1). The first foot of the line or hemistieh
15, 1νο have seen, the place where these abnormal types occasionally appear,
eg. perdita Cist. 686 (just quoted). Hence c.g. periclum (periclrim) could not
be replaced by perimimur as a bacehiae foot.

31. The favoni-ite form of Bacchiae line with Plautus is the v
Tetrameter Acatalcetic. The passages quoted in ἓ 26 may serve as
illustration of the usual characteristics of this type of verse.

(l) Diacresis after the second foot is usual but by no means
obligatory. (In these passages, for example, there is none in Amph..
554, 567, Sto.) It may be accompanied by hiatus, though 01151011 is
