. Act V. Scene i. Hegio appears on the stage by the right-hand
door, having just returned from the harbour. He is aceompanied by
Philocrates and by Philopolemus, his son, who had been captured by the
Eleans and who has been released through Philocrates' ageney. Stalagmus,
the slave who kidnapped Tyndarus, follows in the rear, fettered with a boia
( V. 888). After Hegio's opening song of thanksgiving (in Bacchiae Tetra-
meters, the same metre as the mournful ‘canticum' of Act IV. Sc. ii. )‚ the
metre is Trochaic Septenarii. The courtesy of Philopolemus in the service
of his newly acquired friend, Philocrates, and the sollieitude of the latter
on account of his faithful slave, are cleverly depicted. Tyndarus is
finally sent for, and the two go into the house, leaving Hegio to examine
Stalagmus.

922. Ioui disque. See note on v. 868.

923. Redducem. Though redduco is a common Early Latin form of
the Verb, the form reddum of the Noun is open to doubt (cf. reducem
v. 931). Plautus however uses it again in another Bacchiae Canticum, in
the leudem (v, 909):

Quom me ex suis loeis pulchre ornatum expediuit„
Templis reddwem, plurima praeda onustum.

Similarly recclusz't (v, 918 above), rellatum (Ter. Phorm. 21 Quod ab illo
adlatumst‚ sibi esse rellatum putet> are abnormal forms (Introd. ii. ξ 5).
We have redux in the two oecurrenees of the word in Terence (Haut. 398,
Hee. 852), as, to all appearance, in its single occurrence in the fragments
of the other Republiean Dramatists (Naev. Tray. praet. 2 R. Vita insepulta
laetus in patriam redux); so that many editors would banish it entirely
from Plautus also. Brix points out that the Obliquc Case of the Persona]
Pronoun normally follows the possessivo (cg. vv. 181, 400, 853, &c.) and
transposes Quom reducem tem te p. r. And yet it is in Cantica that the
normal order is most liable to be departed from, and that abnormal forms
of words are most to be expected.
