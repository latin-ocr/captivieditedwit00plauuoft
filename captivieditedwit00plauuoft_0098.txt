72 INTRODUCTION.

(For details see Klotz, Grumlziiye‚ pp. 196, 212.) Octonarii without Diaeresis
are suitable for rapid narration, eg. Amph. 251—2623 cf. 1076—1085. (Other
instances in Klotz, p. 212.)

12. lambio ‘ systems' in Cantica are not infrequent, sometimes written in
Octonarfi, sometimes in Dimeters and the like. For the use of the lambio
Dimeter Acataleetic as a ‘clausula' to end a period Varro (Serm. Lat. frag.
67 Wilm.) quotes Accius' line (665 R.): an hae‘c iam obliti seint Phryyes? In
Cas. 709 sqq. we have a curious run of the ‘metrum' *nstv—z

Si effexis hoc, soleas tibi dabo, et an-
ulum in digitum aureum et bona pluruma.
Operam dabo.
Face ut impetres, &a

(Cf. the ‘ pes thymelicus ' (- ν ν ν -), on which see ξ 38.)
In Amph. 1067 (and elsewhere) we find an arrangement of this kind:

ut iacui, exsurgo. ardere censui aedis, ita tum confulgebant.
ibi me inclamat Alcumenam iam ea res me horrore adficit.

(For further details see Leo, Plautinische Cantica, p. 33.)

13. In Terence a sudden change from Iambic to Trochaic
metre or ‘ vice versa ' is common enough. A single line at the end
of a soliloquy, where the speaker changes his tone, often exhibits
this change, and any sudden change of sentiment in a dialogue-
passage is indicated by this change of metre. In Plautus the
interinixture of Iambic and Trochaic lines is used to express
unusual excitement or einotion. Exainples will be found in Capt.
529 sqq. (where Tyndarus is in momentary expectation of being
detected), Capt. lv, i. (where Ergasilus hurries with the news of
Philopolemus' arrival), Amph. v. i. (Bromia's account of the portents
at the birth of Hercules, vv, 1053 sqq), e.g. vv, 1063—4

ubi quisque institerat, concidit crepitu. ibi nescioquis
maxuma
ucce exclamat: ‘Alcumenzn adest auxilium, ne time.'

It is possible that we have Terence's use of the change in Bacch. 404 and
other passages (eg. Amph. 252 sqq) Mar. Victorinus (57. 14 K.) says: nam et
Menander in comoediis frequenter a continuatis iambicis versibus ad trochaicos
transit et rursum ad iambicos redit. On the blending of Iambic and Trochaic
Metre in thc sanic line, see ξ 4. For fuller details cf. Klotz, Grztndz. p. 471.

B. Trochaic.

14. In Trochaic Verse, the prevalent types being the Septe-
narius or Tetrameter Catalcctic and the Octonarius or Tetrameter
Acatalectic, the sanic resolvod feet are allowed as in Iambic Verse,
