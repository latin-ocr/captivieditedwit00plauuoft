Meser. METHUEN have in preparation an edition of those novels of Charles
Dickens which have now passed out of copyright. Mr. George Gissing.
whose critical study of Dickens is both sympathetic and acute, has written
an Introduction to each of the books, and a very attractive feature of this
edition will be the illustrations of the old houses, inns, and buildings, which
Dickens described, and which have now in many instances disappeared
under the touch of modern civilisation. Another valuable feature will be
a series of topographical and general notes to each book by Mr. F. G. Kitton.
The books will be produced with the greatest care as to printing, paper
and binding.
