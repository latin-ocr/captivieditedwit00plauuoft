36 INTRODUCTION.

of the sentence is never shortened. Philippus, the name of the coin,
was, as we have seen (ξ 11), accented on the first syllable in imitation
of the Greek. The Adverb perinde (with proinde, deinde) was
accented on the first syllable, as we are told by the Latin Gram-
marians (Priscian XV. 9, p. 67 3 cf. Serv. ad Aen. vi. 743), which
accounts for the scansion perinde in Stich. 520 U‘t cuique homini ‘res
parata est perinde amicis mitur (A, Charisius) 3 cf. Phorm. 668, and
see other examples in Esch, p. 43. The scansion saqitta (apparently
a loan-word) may be accounted for in the same way. It is the

scansion of the word in its three occurrences in Plautus, Pers. 25,
Aul. 395, Tria. 725.

So with satellites of Trin. 833 : Dis-traxissent disque tulissent satellites tui me
miseram foede (ΑΡ) (Anap.), another loan-word. Some however explain the
shortening by the accentuation of the word-group satellites-zui, and apply the
same explanation to siirzillztmcze-szmt of Asin. 241: Portitorum simillumae sunt
ianuae leno'niae (for another suggestion regarding the scansion of this line see
Class. Rev. vi. 342). The scansion dedistine Trin. 129: Dedistzne hoc facto ei
gladium, qui se occideret? (MSS.=P) is the result of the accentuation dedistine.
In Ourc. 345 dedistin tu? or dedisti-tu? (so the MSS.) is scanned dedistim) ίνι.
Whether dedisse douo hodie of Amph. 761 is rightly explained by the accentua-
tion of the word-group dedisse-dano is uncertain (cf. Men. 689 dedisti eam dono*
mz‘hz‘; Epid. 474 timi) addam-dano, the probable scansion). The accentuation
senectcffn explains the scansion senecam Cas. 240: Se‘neemn aetate anquentatus
per uias, iynciue, incedis? (senecta MSS.=P, which would leave hiatus. In
Most. 217 the scansion is probably senecta, but whether tibist should be
read with Klotz Grvzozdzzme p. 92 or *in omitted is doubtful). Profecto,
usually a bacchius, is occasionally scanned as an anapaest, e.g. Poen. 907
Profecto ad incitas lenonem rediyet si eas abdzioeerit (ΑΡ, Nonius). (Other exx. in
Esch, pp. 39 sq.) Had it, like perinde, the accent on the first syllable? should
fenestra (Mil. 379 dle), the invariable scansion in Plautus, be changed to sestra
(Paul. Fest. 64. 33 Th. ‘festram’ antiqui dicebant quam nos ‘fenestram '), oris
the shorter form itself to be explained by an accentuation fenestra?

24. And other apparent extensions of the Law probably either
depend on niceties of Latin Accentuation which cannot be formulated
by us with certainty, or are corrupt readings.

Here are the most notable instances z—I’lrilb'oeene Bacch. 1106: A. Philoxene,
salue. B. Et tu. Unde agis? A. Unde homo miser atque infortunatus (is the
metrc rightly supposed to be anapaestic ?); ‹luibae-eff) Merc. 447: A. Quiesce,
inquam. Ι Istanc rom ego recte uidero, B. Quid ais? A. Quid est ¹? (MSS.=P)
(rather scan quiesce, ξ 15); in Cas. 496 Quibus battuatur tibi os, senex nequis-
sume (MSS. ΞΡ), the shortening of the emphatic word os is without a parallel
(ds tibi· Mueller ; cf. ἓ 15) ; (Ιιιὶἀ &mprobras Trin. 318: Quid exprobras? bene quod

which it would receive in its sentence. The word voluptas standing alone was
accented υοῖιῑριακ, but in the phrase voluptas mea ‘my darling‚’ the accentuation
was voluptas-nim (sce above, ἓ 21). Cf. Gk. πρός but πρὸς πόλιν (see Appendix).
