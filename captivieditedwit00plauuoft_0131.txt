THE PLAY.

Nothing is known of the origin of the Captivi, a Comedy pronounced
by the youthful enthusiasm of Lessing to be ‘the finest piece ever put
upon the stage 1.' And yet our curiosity is strongly stirred by the singular
features of this drama, which claims a place for itself apart from and
above all the other dramas of the New or Middle Comedy that are known
to us. Can it have been the one dramatic venture of some cultured
Athenian, who in a happy moment conceived the idea of purifying and
spiritualizing the stock characters and incidente of the Comedy of his
time? Or is its isolation due merely to the loss of all the other productions
of its author? The tyrannica] father, outwitted by intrigue (comicus stultus
senex), is here replaced by a wonderfully attractive type of the γέρων
εὔκολος, as full of ‘bonhomie' as Periplectomenus in the Miles Gloriosus,
but of far greater depth of character and width of sympathy, who reproves
more in sorrow than in anger, and never for a moment loses our sincere
respect and hearty good-will. In Philocrates and Philopolemus we
have an agreeable change from the hackneyed type of profligate son
(amns ephebus), selfishly intent on his own vicious or, at best, thoughtless
schemes; while the cunning slave (servulus callidus) receives a veritable
apotheosis in the part of Tyndarus, the real hero of the drama, with his
noble sels-sacrifice for the sake of his master, and his gay, gallant bearing
under the worst reverses of fortune. Even the Parasite is toned down to
a harmony with the rest of the picture. His hunger and his flattery
always amuse, never revolt us, and cannot be said to pass the bounds
of reason until the climax of the play is reached, when we ourselves are
so transported with the enthusiasm of the moment as to pass without
protest into his extravagant mood. The moving passion of the play is not,
as of other plays, the passion of love, generally (though the Trinummus
forms an exception) dishonourable love3 it is the chivalrous devotion of a
servant to his master: and it is this change of motive which transforms
the whole tone of the drama.
