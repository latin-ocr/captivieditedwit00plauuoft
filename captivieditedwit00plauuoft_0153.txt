here by the Auct. ad Herenn. iv, 11. 16: socii ‘nostri cum belliyerare nobis-
cum vellent. Postquam belligerant. The Historical Present with
postquam is generally accompanied by the same Tense in the main clause,
as here: postquam belliyerant...capitum and V. 487 abeo ab illis, postquam
uideo me sic ludificarier. Cum Aleis. Hiatus of monosyllabic words
ending in -m or in a long vowel is most frequent in Latin poetry when
accompanied by a short syllable, eg. quz' rimant Virg., but we have in
Plautus also scansions like de hordeo (with —e unelided) Asin. 706, cum 11αο
cum istae (with —mn unelided) Cas. 612 (see Introd. ii. ξ 41). There is no
need therefore of supposing Plautus to have used the native form Valgi
(Ραλεῖοι) for Alei. (On coins of Elis, of which we have examples as late as
the 2nd century Bo, the name appears as Ραλείων, Gen. Pl.) The rhythm
of the line suffers from the clash of accent and metrical ictus in the
spondee in the fourth scot, (Aet)0ci; but the difficulty of fitting into one
verse so many polysyllabic words may serve as excuse (see Introd. iii. ξ 7).
We need not suppose a word to have dropped out from the line. History
is silent about this war between 'Aetolia and Elis, which may have
occurred in the troubled times that followed the death of Alexander the
Great. (Cf. Hueffner, de Plaut. Com. Eoeempl. Act. p. 314.) The line
closely corresponds with v. 93 Ita mmo belliqerant Aetoli cum Aleis.

25. Vt fit is not found elsewhere in Plautus.

26. Emit, Perf. not Pres, for ibidem is the normal scansion in
Plautus (Introd. ii. ξ 16).

27. Hic, Pron. (of. v. 7).

28. Posset is changed by most editors to possit. But Plautus does
not follow the rules of Sequence of Tenses so strictly as Oicero3 and in
view of passages like Pseud. 795—6:

Quin ob eam rem Orcus recipere ad sc hunc noluit,
Ut esset hic qui mortuis cenam coquat,

the change cannot be said to be necessary.
Si quem reperire posset, ‘in hope to find someone.' This final sense

of si is well established. Apart from the phrase expectare si (Subj.),
