30. (9) Mute and. Liquid. When a vowel naturally short
precedes a Mute and Liquid, the syllable is never lengthened by
‘position' by the Republican Dramatists as it is in other poetry.
While Ennius in his Epic and Lucilius in his Satires allow thern-
selves such scansions as myrum, febris, fibras, triclini, the Drama-
tists recognize only myrum, triclini, &e The syllables were apparently
short in the ordinary every-day utterance of their time, just as in
Greek¹3 so that umorum, febris, &a represent the colloquial pro-
nunciation‚ while myrum, febris belong to the artificia] language of
poetry. That this distinction holds even for the fourth century ΑΒ.2
we see from the remark of Servius on perciyro in Virg. Aen. i. 384:
‘per-' habet accentum...Muta enim et liquida quotiens ponuntur
metrum iuvant, non accentum.

On rnbrica (Truc. 294) see ἓ 5. What Sisenna refers to when he says of a
passage (in the Rudens?) of Plautus: ‘latronem’ producit metri causa (Rufinus,
Comm. in Metra Terent. p. 561 Κ.) is not clear.

31. Very suspicious is the scansion ῖηιπιὸ (Merc. 737, Cist. 565, Hec. 877,
437, 726, Phorm. 936, Caecilius 128 R). The old theory that the first syllables
of omnis (Birt in Rheinisches Museum, li. p. 240), inter, ille were ‘half-long’
and might be scanned on occasion as short by the Dramatists should be
abandoned. All the sure instances of bonnis, inter, illos, etc. are found to
come under the Law of Breves Breviantes, διο. (eg. Mil. 55), while illst)
(ξ 14), not ‘illes is the true pronunciation in lines like Capt. 105.

32. Α few other points of Plautine Prosody may be treated
here :—

In the Dat. Abl. Plur. of io-stems Plautus and Terence use only
the full form dis. similarly in the Adverbs (originally Ablatives
Plural) qratiis (cf. ἓ 15), iozyratiis.

Flayicis is ascribed to Turpilius (162 R), a poet of c. 115 nc. (al. flagiti).
Details of the scansion of Compounds of {acio (eg. abjecit), c‘ib‘z'cio) are given by
Mather in Harvoerd Studies vi.

In the Third Person Plura] of the Perfect Indicative -ἒγτωιι is
more favoured than irunt by the Dramatists 3 they use the latter form
only through metrical exigencies, at the end of the line or hemistich

¹ In the Greek Drama the lengthening by ‘position' of such syllables is
more a feature of Tragedy than Comedy. In the New Comcdy even the heavier
combinations os Mute and Liquid do not necessitate long scansion (Perschinka
in Dissert. le'lol. Vindobonenses‚ iii. 36s).

2 Still in Vulgar Latin, whether in consequence of the mispronunciation
with parasitic vowel between the mute and liquid, or from some other cause, the
combination seems to have produced length by position and to have attracted
the accent. Tho Romance languagcs (eu. Span. tinieblas) point to tenebrae,
δια, as the Vulgar Latin pronunciation (Lat. Lam). iii. 5 11).
