1 7--19l PROLOGVS. 123

Fugitiuus ille, ut dixeram ante, huius patri
Domo quem profugiens dominum abstulerat uendidit.
Is postquam hunc emit, dedit eum huic gnato suo

18. profugiens B3VEJ : profugens B¹D abstulerit El, corr. B2 ut vid.
19. Is Fleckeisenus: Hic libri

17. Dixeram. The Pluperfect Ind. of sum is frequently used for the
Perfect in colloquial Latin (eg. V. 305) ; but probably not the Pluperfect
of other Verbs. We must take the Tense here to imply ‘1 had said, prior
to the disturbance which caused my digression’ (cf. ad v. 938). In the
Mostellaria (820—1) the expression emptifuerant, ‘they were bought,’ that
falls from the lips of Simo, is seized upon by the cunning slave Tranio as a

means of making his master Theoproprides believe that Simo has again sold
the house which he had purchased:

ΤΗ. Non uideor uidisse postis pulcriores, SI. Pol mihi
Eo pretio empti fuerant olim. ΤΒ. Audin ‘fuerant' dicere?

This use of fueram for fui was the beginning of that tendency to substitute
the Pluperfect for the Perfect which we see in Late Latin and which is
reflected in the Romance Languages, eg. Old French vidra, ‘he saw.'
(For a fuller account see Blase, Gesclzz'chte cles Plusquamperfelcts. Giessen,
1894.) On the scansion buiris patri see note on v. 4.

18. The reading of the original (pun) of our MSS„ profuyens, can be
so easily explained by the practice of writing 9 and z· in ligature in early
minuscule that it would be unwise to reject the correction supplied in
other MSS„ profuyiens. It may however be mentioned that in the only
instance of the Adj. prosuyvs in Plautus, Prin. 701 Effuyias esc urbe inanis,
pmfuqus patriam deseras, our MSS. offer the unmetrical profiayiens, which
editors suppose to have been a gloss written above profuyus in some early
archetype (cf. profuyus: profugiens Loewe, Glossae Nominum, p. 205).
Since the traces of the Aorist Tense in Plautus are limited to ‘Aorist'
Subjunctives like evenat (Pres. eveniat), attigas <Pres. attz'nyas), which are
few in number and of restricted usage, it would be hazardous to add to
them a. supposed ‘Aoi-ist' participle, prosaycas (cf. class. Lat. parens,
Pres. pariens); though it must bc allowed that the normal rhythm
would be secured for this line by reading Domi] quem profuyems‘ (or pro-

fu9u3); see note on v, 111. Dominum, ‘his young master,' filium
erilem.

19. Is. The use of lzz'c in the sense of is (the Pronoun that indicates
6 person or thing already mentioned) is not unknown in a later age; and
if the reading of the MSS„ hi«.- postquam lzunc emit dedic eum huic ynam
suo, be right, there would be reason for believing that this portion at least
