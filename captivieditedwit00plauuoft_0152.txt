Peculiarem, quia quasi una aetas erat. 20
Hic nunc domi seruit suo patri, nec scit pater.
Enimuero di nos quasi pilas homines habent.
Rationem habetis, quo modo unum amiserit.

of the prologue was not written by Plautus. But the reading may be
merely a scribe’s error, due to the recurrence of the Demonstrative liic in
this and the neighbouring lines (cf. v. 335). Perhaps is had, as so often
happens in early MSS, been niisspelt liis. Emit is probably not
Historical Present (ἔφηιῖί) like belliyemnt in V. 24, where the main verb
capitur is also Hist. Pres, but Perfect (emam so dedit will have pyrrich
scansion.

20. Quasi una, ‘about the same,’ a common use of quasi (as of Ital.
‘quasi'); cf. Sall. Hist. iii. fr. 26 quami par festinatio, Their age was four
years, at the time of the action of the play twenty-four (cf. v. 980). The
change to quasi una aetate erat (cf. lisere. 520 Da chm'ficio neminem timeo,
una aetate quae sit) would be easy, hut is not necessary. Nor need we
follow some editors in bracketing or transposing after V. 4 the two following
lines, vv. 21—2. Like vv, 50- 51 they serve the purpose of impressing on
the minds of the audience a cardinal point of the plot (see note on v. 44).
The moral reflection in v. 22 finds a fitting place at the end of the story
of Tyndarus, as the similar moral reflection in v. 51 is placed at the end
of the rest of the narrative.

lia nita est hominum quasi quom ludas tesseris, Alexis fr. 34 K. Τοιοῦτο τὸ
ζῆν ἐστιν ὥσπερ οἱ κίβοι, Dekker, Old Fortunatus Ι. i. “This world is
Fortune's bal] wherewith she sports.⁷' Enimuero. Pylades’ emenda-
tion of the est uero of the MSS. is generally adopted, although a change of
enim to est in early MSS. is not easy to explain. Est uerum in the sense
of ‘rerum est verbum quod wmzoratzcr (Truc. 885) is less likely, though more
easy to account for on palaeographical grounds (cf. vero and verum confused
in the MSS. at V. 75), and the same may be said of Hem uero di nos, &Q
(cf. T cr. Pliorm. 790 [IIem] uir uiro quid praestat).

23. Rationem habetis. The phrase is quite in keeping with the
metaphor of v. 16. Of. Most. 304 ratio accepte? atque expensi.

24. Bellvgqem, for bellum yero, an Active compound of the same type
as the Deponent moriyeror (v. 198 &c.)‚ for morem ymo, is used precisely as
