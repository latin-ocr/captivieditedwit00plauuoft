16 INTRODUCTION.

Leo’s theory that final s may be elided (like final m) before an initial vowel
is supported by strong arguments (Plaut. Forsch.. pp. 224 sqq.). The spelling
-est for -Js est, eg. qualest for qualis est, similest for similis est, is one piece of
evidence adduced by him. But the theory seems to be unlikely on ‘a priori'

ἰ grounds and to have no certain instances in the lines of Plautus to vindicate
l it (see Maurenbrecher p. 98). On factust for faetus est, δια, see below, ξ 12.

Similarly in words or word-groups like sanusne (samm), priusquam (prius
quam) cllo„ we find the short scansions ,ςαηϊὶη (ἓ 1), priusquam (seldom prius-
quam, with second syllable long by position), e.g. Enn. Tray. 239 R. (in a prayer) :

I'nspice hoc facinus priusquam fiat: prohibessis scelus3
a scansion like nimisque is not found (Leo, Plaut. Forseh. p. 268).
The incide-nce of ictus on ‘ohe syllable is quite consistent with the
short scansion <g 29), eg. dictus Prometheus in an anapaestic line of
Accius (Tray. 534 R). So scan Amph. 903 ‘nimffs uerecunda es.

4. -ulus and -lus, -ulum and -lmn have somewhat different
usage in the literary language of Plautus' and of Virgil's time.
When a vowel originally preceded l in these terminations, Plautus
does not allow the syncopated form. The Diminutive Suffix -culo-
(originally -co-Z0—), for example, never appears as -clo— in his lines z e.g.
melculum, not ‘ melliclum,’ in Cas. 837 3 osculi, not ‘ oscli,’ in Stich. 91.
When the vowel is a later insertion, to facilitate pronunciation, this
extended form is not as readily allowed as the older form which
lacked the parasitic vowel: eg. vehiclum (originally -clom, from
-tlom3 cf. Gk. ἅιν-τλον, ἐχέ-τλη) is invariable, never velciculum3
periculum, «ἵε-0., where a long syllable precedes the termination -clom
(dom), is allowed only (but cf. Pers. 524, Eud. 169) at the end of
a line, i.e. through metrical necessity ;

Capt. 740 periclum vitae meae tuo stat periculo.

We must therefore read passerculum (with Diminutive suffix -eo-lo-) in Asin.
666; mele-ulma (with Dim. snslix) in Cure. 11; iza-orcula (with Dim. suffix) in
Cas. 9l7; oraclo (with suffix -tlo-) in Men. 8413 tabernaclum (with -tlo-) in
Amph. 428; celocla (celae-uz) in Mil. 10()h; circos, not ‘circlos' (circo-lo) in
Accius Tray. 100 R.; mundulos, not ‘ *mztmllos‘ in Truc. 658. (For fuller details
see Classical Review, vi. 87.) Plautus uses the older form poplus (cf. Popzi-cola)
as well as the classical populus, eg. Pseud. 126, Stich. 490—2.

See Studcmund (in Fleckeiscn’s Jahrbiicher cxiii. 64) for examples of extempulo
at the end of the linc in Plautus, ‘Hercule' (Asin. 275, dre), ‘exempulum’
(Asin. 389) are doubtful.

5. Other ‘ early’ forms. Frvtslrffl, contrfi were the Adverbs
in use in the time of Plautus 3 ⁸frusto-(Z, couti-(Z (altered to the type of
eastra, supra dvc), in the Augustam age (for details see Wolffiin in
Archiv Lat, Leoeilcoyr. ii. l) 3 just as collus, vacivus were the Plautinffi
collum, vacuus the Augustan forins. Beside sacer (sciero, 2 Decl.)
