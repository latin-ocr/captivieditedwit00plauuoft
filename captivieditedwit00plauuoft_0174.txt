146 PLAVTI CAPTIVI. [95-99

Philopolemus, huius Hegionis filius 95
Senis, qui hic habitat, quae aedes lamentariae

Mihi sunt, quas quotienscumque conspicio, fleo——,
Nunc hic occepit quaestum hunc fili gratia ⁵
Inhonestum et maxime alienum ingenio suo:

95. Huius (see note on v. 7).

96. Lamentariae, a novel formation on the type of amentarius unguen-
tarius, frumentarius, &c The suffix -arz‘zcs was much in vogue in early Latin,
though later it was often supplanted by -ανί3, Mummius, for example,
occurs instead of class. militaris in Pseud. 1048 Quin hinc metimur gradibus

another Plautine coinage ; Stich. 258 A. Liozyuam quoque etiam uendidv'

So is manifestarius for mamfestus. These forms are suitable for line-
endings. A pause would follow, while Ergasilus gave way to his emotion.

98. Hic. In classica] Latin poetry Ιιῑό Nom. Sg. has acquired the
scansion of a long syllable, a phrase like lzz'c est being pronounced, as the
Grammarians tell us, ‘hice est' (ef. O.I.L. ix. 60 Accessi terras conplures:
terminus lzz'cc esc). This pronunciation, which seems to have followed the
pronunciation of hoc Neut., originally *laod-ce, then by assimilation hoe-002)
(cf. hoccine), cannot be shewn to be as early as Plautus. He seems to
know only Ῐεῖσ Nom., mc (heic) Adv. (lutrod. ii. ἕξ 5, 32). Here, since the
metre requires a long syllable, laio must be the Advcrb, ‘in this house,'
the locale of the ‘quaestus carcerarius' (v. 129). Schoell proposes laic
<kom0>3 and laic <Ιιίσ> is also conceivable. But no alteration is required.
Occepit quaestum. Ter. Andr. 79, Adel. 206. Quaestum hunc.
Ergasilus points to the Captives (see note on v. 38), who probably have
remained on the stage (see note on v. 252).

99. Et, «Asyndeton is a common feature of the early language, and is
so often effaced in our MSS. by a scribe's insertion of et, que, atque, and
the like, that one is tempted to adopt here the reading of the Codex Vetus
(B) and omit et (ef. note on v. 718). On the other hand the ‘consensus' of
DVE is proof that et mraxime was the reading of tho common archetype
of BD ΓΕ (Introd. i. ξ 8), so that the omission of et in B is not likely to be
anything more than a seribe’s error. Alienum ingenio. The
Preposition is found in Mil. 1288 Inla07cesta..,atqne aliena α bonis. The
