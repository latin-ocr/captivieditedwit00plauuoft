Nothing pleased a Roman audience better than the scenio representation
of war with all its paraphernalia. Cf. Hor. Epp. ΙΙ. 1. 189 sqq. (quoted in
note on v. 62).

60. Since mediaeval scribes and ancient copyists too made a practice
of changing the Old Latin Adverb illi into illic, whenever the context
made it clear that the Adverb and not the Dat. Sg. of the Pronoun was in

question, we need have no scruples about writing illi for illio of the MSS.
here and in many other passages. It is probable‚ though not certain,

that the scansion foy-{s illi e‘xtra seducam suits the line better, for foris,
being emphatic (cf. v. 136), should not be ‘in thesi‚' and illic was
accented on the final syllable. The speaker points to his right as he says
these words, for the stage-door on his right hand (i.e. on the spectator's
left) was the conventional aditus α pereyo-e. Thus in the Amphitruo when
Sosia comes in from the harbour, Mercury says (v. 333) Hinc em'm mihi
dextra uox auris, ut uidetur, uerberat. <See above, p. 112.) Scenam‚
the spelling in the archetype of our MSS„ may be a mere error, like
questoribus (v. 111) &c. Scaena is the normal spelling; still Varro
(L. L. vii. 96) tells us that Accius spelt the word in the Greek fashion with
the single vowel.

61. Ultor-assum, ‘instrumentum scenarum’ (Paul. Fest. 36. 34 Th.>‚ is
one of the numerous Greek words in the diction of the Roman theatre
(cf. πάλιν, ‘encore‚’ Tria. 7053 πάντες, ‘the whole troupe‚' a stage-direction
at the end of the Perga in the ‘ Palatine' recension). On inscriptions of
the Empire we find mention of an official of the Imperial Theatre, the
procurator summi chorayii.

62. The traditional reading desubito nos ayere tragoediam could be
allowed only with the doubtful scansion (igere craycfedz'am (the contrast
between comico and trayoeclz'am being emphasized in pronunciation by
throwing the stress of the voice on the first syllable of trayoediam to the
detriment of the second). For while a tribrach may be dividtd between two
