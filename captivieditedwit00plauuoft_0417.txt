History and Biography

THE LETTERS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
ssg‘zngezszndzeljdited with N otes by SIDNEY COLVIN. Demy 8v0.

These highly important and interesting volumes contain the correspondence of
Robert Louis Stevenson from his eighteenth year to almost the last day of his lise,
selected and edited‚ with notes and introductions‚ by Mr. Sidney Colvin, his most
intimate friend. The letters are very various in subject and character, being
addressed partly to his family and private friends, and partly to such well known
living or lately deceased men of letters as Mr. Hamerton, Mr. J. A. Symonds,
Mr. Henry James, Mr. James Payn, Dr. Conan Doyle, Mr. J. M. Barrie, Mr.
Edmund Gosse‚ Mr. F. Locker-Lampson, Mr. Cosmo Monkhouse‚ Mr. Andrew
Lang, Mt. W. E. Henley‚ and the Editor himself. They present a vivid and
brilliant autobiographical picture of the mind and character of the distinguished
author. It was originally intended that a separate volume containing a full
narrative and critical Life by the Editor should appear simultaneously with the
letters, and form part of the work: but the publication of this has sor various
reasons been postponed.
