1 2 INTRODUOTION.

19. For a history of the vicissitudes of the text of Plautus in
antiquity, prior to the composition of A and ΡΑ, our materials are
too few. The variant readings already alluded to are to be referred
partly to the work of scholars like Varro and Valerius Probus,
partly to re-castings by stage managers for the convenience of an
audience such as that addressed in the prologue to the Casina

(vv. ll sqq.):
nam postquam populi rumore intelleximus
studiose expetere uos Plautinas fabulas,
anticuam eius edimus comoediam,
quam uos probastis qui estis in senioribus3
nam iuniorum qui sunt non norunt, scio'.

Even the question whether the first collected edition of Plautus'
plays was made in the time of Varro (Usener in Nachricht. Gottiny.
Gesellscltafl 1892, p. 201) or in the time of Valerius Probus (Leo
l'lautinisclw Forsclmnyen, chap. i.) cannot be settled from the
evidence at our disposal.

II. PROSODY.

The difference between the Prosody of Plautus and the Prosody
of the Augustali poets is due to two causes :

(1) Certain syllables were pronounced differently in the time
of Plautus and in the Augustan age ;

(2) Plautus uses the ordinary colloquial forms of everyday life,
whereas the diction of Augustan poetry was in great part an artificia]
languagc, with artificia] forms, like our pronunciation of the Noun
‘wind’ in poetry so as to rhynle with ‘mind'

A. Early Latin Peculiarities. The peculiarities of Plautine
Prosody which belong to Early Latin, as opposed to Classical Latin
pronunciation‚ arc these :—

l. Many final syllables were long by nature (ie. contained a

long vowel) in the time of Plautus, which caune later to be pro-
nounced with a short vowel, viz.:—
