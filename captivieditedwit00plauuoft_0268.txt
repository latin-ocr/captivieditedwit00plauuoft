Act ΙΙΙ. Scene ii. Hegio, accompanied by Aristophontes, an Elean
captive whom he has found in his brother's eoyastulum, comes on
the stage by the left-hand door, and sings a song, in expression of 1118
delight at the speedy prospect of recovering his captured son. This
bright, lively Canticum, with' its rapid variation of metres, stands in
marked contrast to the dejected Palinode of Act 1v. Sc. ii. Its arrange-
ment offers considerable difficulty ; for in the Archetype of our MSS. the
original division of lines 498—503, and probably of others too, has been
abandoned for the sake of saving space. I suppose the first and third
lines to be Anapaestic Dimeters, the second and fourth Bacchiac Tetra-
meters (though 111 the second the pyri-ich scansion eye is not what we
should expect in Bacchiae meti-e). Then the inetre suddenly changes to a
Trochaic Octonarius Ϊία me...o-ecldideo·2mt. Two Bac-chiac Tetraineters
follow, and then a line composed of four Oatalectic Bacchiae Dimeters
(or Dochmii 2) [3096 synymplzeim, &Q a composition admirably adapted
for the expression of a rapid sequence of incidents. The next line is
generally scanned as a Bacchiae· Tetraineter, but the shortening of the last
syllable of ilico and the ictus on the second are quite unlikely. It may be
an lambio Dim. Catal. with a Bacch. Dim. Then comes an Anapaestic
Tetrameter Acatalectic, followed apparently by a couple of lines composed
of a Trochaic Dimeter Oatalectic and a ‘colon Reizianum! The succeeding
line may be a Trochaic Dimeter Acatalcctic with the same ‘colon Rei-
manum] V. 513³ is a Trochaic Dimeter AcatalcctiC, and the last two
lines arc lambio.

quisque habitant, iwmenit, Men. 522 satine, ut quemque conspicor, Ita me
Zudzfieant? With the Rcflexivc Pronoun and Possessive the use of the
Plural is more normal, eg. Epz‘d. 212 Filios suos quisque uisum.
