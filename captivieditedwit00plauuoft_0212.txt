249. Scio equidem, not ‘scio quidem,⁷ is the Plautine phrase (eg. Prin.
353, 698), 60 that We must suppose the quidem of the MSS. in this line to
be a corruption of equidem. (Cf. note on nam equidem, v. 394.)

250. Memoriter meminisse, a favourite jingle. Cf. Poen. 562 memi-
nistis memoriter, Amph. 417 memorat memoriter, Afranius Com. 365 R.

Act II. Scene ii. (Trochaic Septenarii). Hegio eomes out of the
house and questions Philocrates, the supposed slave, about his master,
then broaches 130 Tyndarus the proposal for 611 exchange of prisoners.
Tyndarus persuades him to send Philocrates to negotiate the exchange.
In this scene Hegio eonfirms the good impression he left in Act Ι. Sc. ii.
of his kindly disposition, and the audienee must endorse Tyndarus' descrip-
tion of his father as optimus hominum lzomo (v. 333). The assumption by
Tyndarus of the character of master, and by Philocrates of slave, gives
scope for elever acting, especially in the part of Tyndarus, the leading part
in 13116 piece, with the change from his natiu²al tone in the passages uttered
‘aside' to the audience to the assumed tone in which he addresses Hegio.
Nor does the dramatist neglect the opportunity of indicating the irony of
the situation in the dialogue between Hegio and his unreeognized son.

251. Spoken by Hegio to some one in the house. His promise is not
kept, for his conversation with the Captivos makes 111111 change 1116 intention
(vv. 449-450, 460). His, ‘the prisoner-s here' (note on v. 38).
Hegio knows that they must be in his vicinity, though he does not yet sec
them.
