30 INTRODUCTION.

and I see no reason for not accepting it in Tmo. 696:
Iamne—nihil dico. Ι intro, amabo, cedo manum.

(Cf. minzi Curc. 155?) (For more details see Birt in Rheinisches Museum, liv. 43.)
Dehinc is never an iambus in the Comedians, eg. Ad. 22 dehinc ne exspectetis
(ἱνῃιιηιεηῑίιηι fribulae. For ma(he)rcnle of Catullus (xxxviii. 2) and Phaedrus we
have in Plautus *mehercle (3 syll.), eg. Pseud. 1175, Stich. 250 <see Sonnenschein’s
note on Rud. 1365). (On the syncopated form ardus, &e see ξ 7.)

Ο. Law of Breves Breviantes1.

16. This, the most characteristic feature of the prosody of =

Plautus. and the Republican Dramatists‚ is apparently another
point of colloquial Latin pronunciation. The law may be stated in
this way. After a short syllable an unaccented syllable, long by
nature 01· by ‘ position‚' was pronounced ‘half-long' and scanned by
the Dramatists either long or short, when the accent fell 011 the
following syllable or 011 the preceding (short) syllable. Whether
the syllable was definitely shortened, 01· retained most of its proper
long pronunciatimi, was a matter which depended on the nature
of the word and the force of the accent (stress-accent) of the
neighbouring syllable. The auxiliary Adverbs ὀέηέ, maile-2, from
their constant use in phrases like bmwfdctum, wzalefdctum, ‘male-
scinus, &o became definitely reduced to pyrrich words, and are
iuvat-iably so scanned in Latin Poetry2. The auxiliary Pronouns
(395 (Gk. ἐγώ), mihi (older daei), tibi (older daei), were in ordinary
pronunciation (cf. eqo-(lico, tibi-dico, dxc.) pyrrich words. So were
subordinate Adverbs like modo (eg. modo-veni), cito, ibi, nisi (the
few instances of ‘nisi in Plautus have been collected by Brock,
Quaest. Gramm. p. 180), Quintilian tells us that Ῐιᾶυὲ, the salutation
(eg. have-Claudi, havesmster), was always pronounced Ιιᾶυέ3, and
calefacere always calefacere or even calfacere. Servius (ad Aen. vi.
779) says that viden was the pronunciation of his time.

1 Le. breves (syllabae) breviantes (sequentes syllabas).

2 That Plautus ever scans bene, 71111Ιὲ is very doubtful. Of the instances
quoted by Klotz (Grzmdziiye, p. 52) the least unlikely is »nale—habiti Pseud. 133, a
scansion which would indicate an original πιαῖῖι (ξ 38). Ibidem is normal (ibidem
Bacch. 756, Pseud. 1271). Mihi, sibi Sec. are normal in the phrase ‘meins—mihi,
suus-sibi dac. (Scherer in Studeinund’s Studien, ii. 107). 1396 is the normal
scansion of Plautus, but ι’ῃῦ is often found (ἓ 5). Of ‘ita’ there is no sufficient
indication (cf. Amph. 572, (535 ; Capt. 372).

³ Quint. 1. vi. 21 : multum litteratus, qui sine aspiratione et producta secunda
syllaba salutaret (⁴uvfire’ est enini) et ‘calefacere' dixerit potius quam quod
dicimus, his adiciat ‘sace’ et ‘dice' ct similia. Recta est haec via, quis neget?
sed adiacet et mollior et magis trita. So that Martial's have (iii. 95. 1) is an
‘artificial' pronunciation allowed in poctry merely. Siinilarly iu Plautus σαυέ

is found only in two Cretic Cantica (cf. ξ 34“), Most. 324, Pseud. 1296 (but σαυὲ
111 another Cretic linc, Cas. (527).
