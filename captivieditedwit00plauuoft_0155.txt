30. Indaudiuit. The old preposihion endo, ‘in,'‘in1·‚o’ (of. Gk. ἕνδο-θι,
ἕνδο-θεν, 3113011),1ater spelt indo and inda, had dropped out. of use before
the time of Plautus. It remained in compounds like indo—tueri, indu-
perator, indu-pedio, {vedu-yredz'or, most of which were in time ousted by
the rival compounds with in: intueri, imperator, impedio, ingredior, only a
few surviving to the Classical Latin age, eg. indiyeo, indoles. Inaudio
had already supplanted indaudio by zhe time of Terence, and is often
substituted for the older form in MSS. of Plautus. Thus in Stich. 77
indaudiuerz'm is written in the Ambrosian Palimpsest inaudiuerim, but: in
the Palatine MSS. with the same corruption as here, inde audiueram.
Plautus seems never to have used the form iozaudz'o.

31. The line as offered in the MSS. is defective. To restore the melre
by means of the form Valeum (see note on V. 24) is unwise‚ for the MSS.
nowhere give a brace of this form, and the adoption of ib would destroy the
metre in vv. 59, 880. We must suppose either that captum is a corruption
of captivum (as in Epid. 564 captam and captivam are confused in the
MSS), or that some word has dropped out of bhe line (captum <unum>
esse Schoell). With the passage we may compare Epid. 107 captiuam
,qenere proymtam bono In praeda es mercatus.

32. ‘ To save his son he would not save his money.' Parsit. This
is the Plautine form of the Perfec‘c of pareo. In Aul. 381 Profesto eyere
liceat m'sz' peperceris, the true reading may be m'sz' δι’ par-seris, as in True.
375 Utimm α principio rez' item parsisses meae, Ut nune reperez's sauiz‘s, the
Ambrosian Palimpsest, has substituted pepercisses for parsisses. But the
class. form peperct¹ is found in Terence Adel. 562 Nil pepercit. In Early
Latin the Ace. was used with pareo. The ancient formula ab sacrifices,
corresponding to Gk. εὐφήμει, was parcito linquam (Paul. Fest. 279. 9 Th.
‘Parcite linyuam' in sacrifieiis dicebatur, z'al est coerceto, commoto, taeeto);
and the same construction is attested (Schol. ad Virg. Aen. Χ. 532) for
Mil. 1220 Ne parce uocem (where our MSS. have changed uocem to uoez');
cf. Pseud. 78 id quidem hercle ne parsi-s, For the play on the word ef.
Cure. 639 O Pietas mea, Serua me, quando eqo te seruauz' sedulo.

33. Reconciliare. The verb is used more than once in this, but in
