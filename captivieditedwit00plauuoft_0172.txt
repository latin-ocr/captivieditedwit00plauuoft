90. Vel, as in 1:32, 183. The scansion uel tre e'xtra portam must be
excused by the unstressed (enclitic) pronunciation of ire in this phrase
(cf. our ‘to go home,' ‘to go back‚’ with stress on ‘home' and ‘back ²).
Even so, the shortening of a naturally long syllable in a word-group of
this kind by the Law of Breves Breviantes is abnormal (see Introd. ii. ξ 21);
and Bothe's theory is very attractive, that Plautus wrote Vet extra—ilicet
(cf. v, 469), which was at some stage or other of the history of the text
‘modernized⁷ to Vel ire extra—licet. Portam Trigeminam. “The
Porta Triqenzina was in the short piece of the wall between the Aventine
Mount and the river3 through it the road led to Ostia. It was probably
so called from having three arches, but it was connected in legend with
the Trigemini Horatii.'’ Hallidie. Saccum denotes the sack of the
porter (baiulus), to judge from the resolve of the parasite in Alciphron iii. 7
ἐπ’ ἐργασίαν τρέψομαι καὶ Πειραιάδε βαδιοῦμαι, τὰ ἐκ τῶν νεῶν φορτία ἐπὶ τὰς
ἀποθήκας μισθοῦ μετατιθείς. Others understand a reference to begging,
which was practised at the gates of towns, and find a parallel in Trin. 423
Pater quom pereyre ueniet, in portast locus (cf. thylacistae Aul. 518, from
θυλακίζω, to beg, a derivative of θύλακος, a bag or pouch). But saccus
rather suggests a sack carried by a porter (later samarius), than a beggar’s
wallet. Livy xxxv. lO (cf. xli. 27) speaks of an emporium ad Tiberim which
existed extra portam Trz'yeminam as early as 193 Rc. Ergasilus seems to
have thought of employment as a porter there.

91. The spondeo-word (nultum) in the fourth foot injures the rhythm
(see note on v. 24 &c.). Non nullum, an unusual expression, and one
indeed inconsistent with Plautus' use of the double negative in lines like
Rud. 359 Nec te aleator nullus est sapientior. The ternis nonnulli, nonnemo,
nonnihil &e came into vogue at a later time. <Nec 02thth in v. 854, Nec
nihil hodie nec multo plus tu laio ede& is not an example of this usage.)

92. Rex (βασιλεύς), the colloquial word for a patron, frequent in the
Comedians &c. Est potitus hostium (cf. 144, 762, Epid. 532 ynam mea
hostiumst potita), the Passive of potire aliquem alienius roi, eg. Amph. 178
Eum nnnc potiut't pater seruitutz's. The Vcrb is used of undesirable as well
as of good things (cf. Donatus ad Tor. l'horm. ΙΙΙ. i. 5:469 potiri τῶν
μέσων fuit). Luer. iv. 766 has eum mortis Zetesque potitum (eontrast Auson.
[dyc. xv. 50 morte potiri), and the phrase necis potior occurs on an epitaph
