196 PLAVTI CAPTIVI. [291—293

Ad rem diuinam quibus est opus, Samiis uasis utitur,

Ne ipse Genius surripiat: proinde aliis ut credat uide.

HEG. Sequere hac me igitur: eadem ego ex hoc quae
uolo exquaesiuero.

291. Rem diuinam is here of four syllables, but trisyllabic in Epid.
316 < U t> dum rem dinam faceret, cantaret sibi. Except in this phrase
diuinus normally precedes its Noun in Plautus Est opus. For the
Dactyl in the fourth foot see Introd. iii. ξ 17. Brix follows the Renaissance
MSS. in reading opus est. Samiis uasis. Bacch. 200 Scis tu ut confrinyz‘
uas cito Samium solet; cf. Men. 179, Stich. 693 :

quibus diuitiae domi sunt, scaphio et cantharis
Batiocis uiuunt, at nos nostro Samiolo poterio.

Cicero Mur. 75 mentions as a proof of Tubero's shabbiness: exposuit vasa
Samia. For the arrangement of the clauses cf. Truc. 150 qui aram· solent
ad pueros ire meliust, Cure. 550 tuom qui stynum ad me attulisset, muntium
ne spernerem, Pseud. 108 Utinam quae dicis dictis facta suppetant, &c.

292. Surripiat. See note on v. 8. Proinde. See note on v. 314.
Proinde aliis ut credat uide, like dehinc conicito ceterum Cas 94:

Quin edepol etiam si in crucem uis pergere,
Sequi decretumst. Dehinc conicito ceterum.

293. Hegio, followed by Philocrates, walks across the stage to Tyndarus,
with whom he conver-ses in the presence of the pretended slave. Philocrates
maintains silence during the interview 1111111 1110 critical point is reached in
v. 335, when he interferes in his assumed saucy tone. And yet at v. 360 he
has to be called across the stage to speak to Tyndarus. How is this to be
explained 2

It has been already remarked (note on v. 38) that it is the Demonstra-
tive Pronouns laic, iste, z'lle which play the part of stage-directions in the
plays of Plautus. From them we get indications of the position of the
speakers on the stage. In referring to Philocrates both Hegio and Tyndarus
use the Demonstrative laic, ‘the person beside us⁷ (vv. 294, 295, 297, 340,
345, 349), designcdly varied by iste in vv. 301--2, 351 (sec notes). But in
v. 353, while the ternis of the ‘aestimatio’ are being discussed, he is
referred to by Hegio as ille in speaking to Tyndarus (vv. 353, 354, 359),
and as iste in the command to 1110 gnards (v. 354). The change of Pro-
noun indicates a change of position of tho actors. At v. 353 Hegio leads
Tyndarus asido for 11 private colloquy about money-matters, and the gual-ds
111 1110 same instant move for-ward towards the other prisoner in obedience
