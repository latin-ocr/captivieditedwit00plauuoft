Similarly the Romance forms of a word like ministerium (Ital.
mesticro, Fr. melier, Chaucer's ‘mistery ') point to a pronunciation
musterium, a still further reduction of an earlier ministerium. And
Oicero's story (Div. ii. 40. 84) of Crassus mistaking the cry of a fig-
seller Cauneas! Cauneas J (sc. ficus vendo) for the warning cave ne
eas, shews that cciv& must have been pronounced σᾶυέ, or rather cau
(cf. neu and neve), and that the whole phrase must have been

uttered in some such way as cdu(<?)-n(e)-eas.

17. In the face of all this evidence it is hard to see how the old
theory was ever accepted, that Plautine scansions like οαυέ (normal),
ministerium (occasioned), were due to the ‘ictus of the verse' and
had no existence outside of the metrical line1 1 The explanation of
the shortening is plain. In all languages with stress-accentuation the
syllable with weakest stress in a word or in a sentence is the
syllable which immediately follows or immediately precedes the
syllable with the strongest stress In Latin, if this unaccented
syllable consisted of a short vowel, its weakening took the forn] of
Syncope3 jari-qo (Plaut.) became jstryo, pariyo (Plaut.) became
paryo : or change of quality 3 cib-dyc (Gk. ἄπαγε) became first ala-eye
(cf. αόἔρίί, MSS. of Plaut. Capt. 814), then abiqe. If it shewed
a long vowel it did not suffer this change (Lat. Lcmy. ch. iii. ξ 30),
though it might if the length was length by ‘position’ merely,
e.g. talentum for allamma (τάλαντον). WVhen preceded by a short
syllable, the change it suffered was reduction of its length, from a
long to a less long, a ‘half-long,' or even a short syllable. In the
sentence ‘ex Graecis bonis Latinas fecit non bonas' the strong
stress thrown on the accented (short) syllable of the emphatic word
bonis had the effect of making the second syllable sound as if it too
were a short syllable like the first, so that Terence allows ὂόηῖ3 in

¹ This strange idea that the beat of a line, the cadence marked by the con-
ductor's baton (cf. pollicis ictus Hor), could alter the quantity of the vowel of a

Latin word has led to some surprising attempts at scansion in Plautus, such as
the attempt to scan amica for amica in scitale. 700:

†Amica‚ uter utrubi accumbamus? Abi tu sane superior
(amica P, A n. l. Read mica, Imperat. of micare, sc. digitis),
erilis for erilis in Aul. 599:

†Erile imperium ediscat ut quod frons uelit oculi sciant
(MSS.:P; eri ille WVagner.)

It would, in fact, scarcely leave a single syllable sate which was preceded by a
short syllable. Well may we characterize this type of scansion by a line con-
structed on the same principles:
