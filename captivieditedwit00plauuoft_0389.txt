qu6-m0do. (6) Prepositions (as opposed to Adverbs). Before Nouns in
Latin orthography these were often written as in Compound Verbs‚ e.g. in
cursum, in templum were written incursum, intemplum like incurro, &c.
(7) Relatives or Indefinites (as opposed to Interrogatives) (cf. ‘Who is
the person who denies it‘l'). (8) Certain Conjunctions, unless specially
emphasized. Thus Donatus mentions the different signification conveyed
by accented and unaccented si in the phrase si quando (see below). The
accentuation of si implied doubt on the part of the speaker. (For details
of Latin Sentence-Accentuation see my Latin Lanyuaye, ch. 111.)

3. The Latin Grammarians generally content themselves with citing
these words as the Latin equivalents of the Greek Enclitics (τε, ἐστι, τις,
εἷς, εἶ, &c.)‚ and do not state the precise details of their pronunciation in
Latin, a statement which would indeed imply more familiarity with the
science of Phonetics than could be expected in their time. Quintilian
however gives us the valuable hint that these subordinate words in
Latin were really fused into a compound with their neighbouring word,
eg. circum-litora in Virgil (Inst. Or. Ι. v. 25: cum dico ‘circumfflorass
tanquam unum enuntio dissimulata distinctione, itaque tanquam in una
voce una est acuta), though how far we may press the conclusions that
seem naturally to result from his statement is doubtful. It has been
suggested that in postposition of the Relative, eg. Troiae qui primus ab
om‘s...vem't‚ the enclitic or subordinate Pronoun would be joined in pro-
nunciation into one word-group with the preceding Noun with accentuati0ss

Troiad-qui. (Cf. qui homo, a word—group in Plautus, scanned qui-home.)
At any rate we may be certain that in Latin, as in other languages, an
enclitic became accented before another enclitic. Prepositions were sub-
ordinate in stress to the nouns which they accompany, eg. ad-zzwhem, but
before an enclitic pronoun would receive the acoent, e.g. sid-me. Of. our
‘ with-hjm‚' ‘f6r-him.² When the pronoun was emphatic, it of course would
receive the stress, eg. ad-me' non acl-td. Cf. om· ‘with-him, not with-her!

4. The Latin Accent was mainly an accent of stress, and different
from the Greek acccnt of tone or pitch, though its stress was not strong
enough, except in special circumstances (see Intr. ii. ξ 11), to overmaster
the quantity of a vowel. An educated Roman pronounced orator with the
stress of the voice on the second syllable, but without impairing the
quantity of the initial 0; the final o of pom) retained its length, in spite
of the fact that the stress of tho voice fell on the first syllable ; the first
syllable of piper had the stress-accent along with the short quantity, and
so on¹. It was thus possible for the Romans to imitate the quantitative
metres of the Greeks, in which the harmonicus or metrical element of the
line consisted of the regular arrangement of long and of short syllables.

¹ But in course of time stress conquered quantity. In the early Empire ponii
became the universal pronunciation, and we hear later of orator and piper as
current mispronunciations (Consentius, p. 391 Κ).
