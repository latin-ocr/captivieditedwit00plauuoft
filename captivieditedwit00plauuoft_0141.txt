PROLOGVS. 1 1 5

knowledge be conveyed to them except through the Prologue, for the only
actor in the piece who could have enlightened them is Stalagmus3 and he
does not appear on the scene till the play is nearly over. There is, t00‚
another justification for the narrative in the prologue. The plays of the
Republican Dramatists were performed in the open air on some public
holiday to a chance crowd. A complicated plot like that of the Captivi,
including the assumption by Philocrates of the part of Tyndarus and by
Tyndarus of the part of Philocrates, would require to be explained twice
to such an audience. What appears to us garrulous prolixity in some of
the prologues of Plautus was due to the practica] necessity of securing the
attention and the intelligence of a restless crowd of holiday-seekers. In
the Amphitruo, where Jupiter personates King Amphitruo and Mercury his
slave Sosia, there is a long prologue in which the spectatore are first coaxed
into good humour and attention, and finally, after being told the plot of
the piece, are informed that the divine ‘Sosia' will wear feathers on his
cap to distinguish him from his human counterpart, while Jupiter, in the
dress of Amphitruo, will be recognized by the golden knob under his head-
gear. The Menaechmi, the original of the C'omedy of Errors, is another
example of a complicated plot requiring a long, and for our modern taste
over-detailed, prologue.

Of the noisy, restless crowd, to which a dramatic author at Rome had
to submit his production, we get a lively picture in the prologue to the
Poenulus, where the speaker, assuming the functions of a military com-

mander (imperator hinricus v. 4), issues regulations for the discipline of his
raw levies, vv, ll sqq. z

Exsurge, praeco, fac populo audientiam;
............ edicta ut seruetis mea.

Scortum exoletum ne quis in proscaenio

Sedeat, neu lictor uerbum aut uirgae muttiant,
Neu dissignator praeter os obambulet

Neu sessum ducat, dum histrio in scaena siet.
Diu qui domi otiosi dormierunt, decet

Animo aequo nunc stent, vel dormire temperent.
Serui ne obsideant, liberis ut sit locus,

Vel aes pro capite dent; si id facere non queunt,
Domum abeant, nitent ancipiti infortunio,

Ne et hic uarientnr uirgis et loris domi,

Si minus curas-sint, quom eri reueniant domum.
Nutrices pueros infantis minutulos

Domi ut procurent neu quac spectatum adferat,
Ne et ipsae sitiant et pueri percant fame

Neue esurientes hic quasi haedi obuagiant.
Matronae tacitae spectent, tacitae rideant,
Canora hic uoco sua tinnire temperent,
