94 INTRODUCTION.

the prevailing form is υυυυυυυυυ ‚ but v. 990 begins with υ υ υ
instead of -ψ, and v. 990³ with -υυ, Of the Versus Priapeus,
composed of a Glyconis: and a Pherecratean (eg. Catull. Hunc lucum
tibi dedico Η consecroque, Priape), we seem to have an example at the
beginning of the mock-marriage-hymn in the Casina, V. 815 :

sensim super attolle lillmen pedes, noua nupta (mea no. nu. A).

A Glyconie is sometimes followed by a Dochmiac colon (see ἓ 44).

42. Τ116 last line of the above passage of the Bacchides might
be described as a Catalectic Dactylic Tet1·ameter<ss ψ υ L υ υ 4 υ υ Ξ)
rather than as a Glyconic with a ‘dactyl' substituted for the
‘trochee' of the Glyconic. The opening of the third Scene of the
fifth Act of the Casina presents a similar difficulty (vv, 937 sqq.) ε

maxumo ego ardeo flagitio

1166 quid agam meis rebus scio,
nec meam ut uxorem aspiciam:
<0111>1116 palam sunt probra,

where the dactylic type (— υ ψ - υ υ - υ ψ Ξ) 18 exhibited by all the
lines except the last (-υ υ ψ --υΞ>. (The reading of this line
is by 110 means certain.)

In these two passages the presence of a line (or lines) of distinc-
tively Glyconic type enables us to claim the form υυυυυυυυυυ
68 a mere variety of the GlyconiC. But other passages, where all
lines without exception shew this Dactylic form, leave room for
doubt. Some editors find Catalectic Dactylic Tetrameters and not
Glyconics in passages like splen. 114 :

nam quotiens foras ire uolo, 111116 retines, reuocas, rogitas,

Bacch. 626—62722
Mnesiloche, quid fit? Perii.
Di melius faciant. Perii.
Non taces, insipiens? Taceam?
Samis satis non es. Perii.
They are found in the neighbourhood of Cretica
Similarly in Epid. 166 sqq. the two Cretic couplets are each followed by one
linc, which can be regarded as Dactylic, as well as Dochmiac ε

168 quom usust ut pudeat (usus est Leo).
170η ducere te uxorein.
