26 INTRoDUCTION.

14. Suppression of -ἔ in certain pronouns, conjunctions‚ dac.
Like nec beside neque, ac (ie. *affl beside atque, neu beside neve,
dein and proin beside deinde, proinde, we find in Plautus and the
Dramatists ill’ beside ille, πεινῇ beside nempe, quipp' beside quippe,
und', ind' beside unde, inde, quiv' for quive (Amph. 84), and so on.
The forms without -ἔ occur before a word beginning with a con-
sonant. Thus nempe, followed by a consonant-initiaL never is
scanned as a trochee3 quippe, ille only when some emphasis is laid
on them, (hc, &0st All these words are words which in ordinary
discourse would not have much individuality assigned to them.
They would be slurred over, and treated as subordinate words. In
fact ille, in phrases like ille senior, ille reat, ille revenit, became the
mere Definite Article or 3 Pers. Pronoun of the Romance languages
(Ital. il siqnor, il γὲ, Span. el sertor, el re, Fr. il rev-ient). How far
the suppression of -ἔ may be extended to other words in Plautus is
not yet determined.

Such as ‹171t(e) posita Rud. 509, visse) foras Pers. 758, it(e) si itis Poen. 1237,
mitt(e) ‘me sis Pseud. 238, ptime) Philippum Bacch. 272. The particle -ne became
-η after a long vowel, eg. quin for qui-ne. The particle -ce was reduced to -c‚
e.g. illic, illic, horunc. Even in Nouns we find the loss of -ἔ in animal for
animale, calcar for calcare ciac. The old theory that nempe had a by-form nepe,
and that ille was a pyrrich as well as an imnbm, must be abandoned. (For full
details see Skutsch, Forsclmngyen ευτ’ [ατ. Grammatik, i.) Preconsonantal ill(a)‚
Fem. Sing. (originally illa), is unlikely. With -qlts(e), -v(e) we may compare the
use of these Particles in Elision at the end of a line in classical poetry, e.g. Virg.
G. ii. 344 caloremqu(e) Η Inter, Hor. S. 1. vi. 102 pere-zyrevoe) ΙΙ Exn-em.

15. Synizesis in certain words, eg. rei (Lucr. iii. 931) and
other Fifth Declension Genitives (above, 3²6), e} Dat. (Catull. 82. 3),
das (only through metrical necessity disyllabic 3 similarly darum
&c norinallyg see Abraham, Stml. Flaui. 204), ffb} (Lucil. xiV.
20 M), sffi) (Lucr. i. 1022), ΐο, dalem. With these we may mention
the shortened forms of the Gonitive of Pronouns, huius and cuius
(monosyll.) (Lucr. i. 1493 Virg. Cam. ix. 35), illius and istius
(disyll.). Also mi for mila· and ml (the normal form) for nihi-l.

Some prefer to consider these as exanlples of the Law of Breves
Breviantcs and scau σΙόὅ-ω, ἀφ, and oven ‹leno-am, &odem (Skutsch in
,S'atura Viadrz'na. Breslau, 1897). No doubt a word like ἔὸ (Pron.,
Adv„ Verb) was capable of the scansion ἔὸ, and this seems the
preferable scansion in a lino like Cas. 715 <⁷5 nunciam (one of a

¹ Shnilarly uam. non, Ιιῖ, hos, illi, illos δὺο. may be called preconsonantal, and

namque, nonne, hisce (Nom. Pl. Maso), hosce, illisce (Nom. Pl. Masc.), illosce &c-
prevoealic forms, though this distinction is not invariably observed in each case.
