111. METRE. 85

more usual. There is no example of hiatus in these passages, but
we may quote as an instance :

Men. 968 ut absente ero rem Ι eri diligenter.

‘Syllaba anceps’ is also tolerated at the diaeresis, e.g. Truc. 463 :

uosmet iam uide‘tffs, ut ornata incedo.

(2) The arsis immediately preceding the diaeresis is rat-ely
resolved. (In the Amphitruo passage we seem to find an example
of this resolution, v. 570:

perdat. Quid mali sum, ἔνέ, Η tua ex re promeritus 2)

In other words, a second paeon or ionic a minore is avoided in
1116 second foot, as at the end of 1116 line. (For 1116 possible
substitutes for a bacchius and the restrictions of 111611· use see
ἐξ 27—9.)

On the limited part played by the Law of Breves Breviantes in
Bacchiae (and Cretic) Verse, see ii. ἓ 34³.

For details of the Diaeresis of Bacchiae Tetrameters, see Klotz, Grundzstqe,
pp. 218 sq. He shews that in its absence there is usually a Caesura after 1116
first arsis of the second scot, e.g. Poen. 230:

postremo modus muliebris nullust numquam;

and that this Caesura is always found (with or‘without Diaeresis), when the
second arsis of the second foot is ι1660111611.Ί Another example of a Tetra-
meter without Diaeresis is Cas. 667 ι

Insanit. Scelestissimum me esse credo,

where the necessity of bringing the long word into 1116 line has made Diaeresis
ὸ impossible.

On the rarity of the resolution of the arsis immediately preceding the
Dffleresis, see Seyffert, de Bacch. Vers.. p. 21, and Berl. Philol. JfVochenschrvft,
1³96, p. 8483 and cf. Bacch. 11213, Cas. 700.

The Catalectic form of the Tetrameter is occasionally found.
For instance, at the close of a passage in Acatalectic Tetratneters
we have I'ocm. 244 :

016111, salsa sunt, tangere iit non uelis,
with the last foot, uelis, eatalectic.

32. The Bacchiae Dimeter is by no means rare. The first Scene of the
second Act of the Trimmwnns begins with nine Bacchiae Tetrameters followed

by the Dimeter (v. 232):
ad aetatem agundam.
