TYND. Nos fugiamus? Quo fugiamus? LOR. In

haud dehortor.
TYND. Vnum exorare uos sinite nos. LOR. Quidnam

Atque uobis nobis detis locum loquendi.

Sentio quam rem agitis seems to be an Ithyphallic colon (—-v—.÷:*—⁴v),
like oletis locum loquendi v. 212. With ayz's the line is a Cretic Tetram.

209. Dehortor. If this word is a trisyllable (cf. Pom. 674 Neque ‘nos
hortari neque dehortari decet), the line is a Troe-haic Octonarius, like the
preceding. If the vowel of the Preposition is elided (see note on V. 640), it
will be a Septenarius. 86110611 makes the line Anapaestic.

210, 211. Editors are perhaps right in breaking this up into two
Cretic lines, a Tetrameter (Umam...est) and a Dimeter (Ut...arbitrz‘s).
But we have not much reason to believe that the original colometry was
departed from in this canticum by the archetype of our MSS. Exorare
...Sinite Sino takes the lnf. or the Subj. (without ut> in Plautus, eg.
Cas. 136 Sine tuos ocellos deosculer, uoluptas mea, Siue amabo ted amari,
Most. 12 Sine modo adueniat senex: Sine modo uenire saluom. ‘⁴ Exorare,
like orare, takes (1) acc. pers, ‘to persuade,⁷ ‘prevail upon,' (2) acc. rei,
‘to ask successfully‚' ‘to obtain,' and sometimes (3) both accusatives, as
here and Bacch. 1199 lianc ueniam illis sine te emorem, Ter. Andr. 901 sine
te hoc exoremJ' Hallidie. Hisce (866 note on v. 34). Arbitris
(see note on v. 219). The arbitri referred to are the slaves whom the
{orarius had brought with him to act as guards of the Oaptives, according
to Hegio’s orders (v. 115), and whom he leaves behind when he and his
assistants (uobis v. 212) leave the stage (v. 215). It is they who are again
addressed by Hegio in v. 456.

212. 86110611 regards atque vobis as a spurious accretion (produced by
a miswriting uobis for nobis 2> (see note on v. 199). By transposing locum
and loquendi wc should then have a Orctic Trimetcr:

Nobis detis loquendi locum.

But this would bc to re-writc the passage. Detis locum loquendi is
an Ithyphallic colon (cf. ad v. 207).
