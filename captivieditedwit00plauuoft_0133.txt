ARGVMENTVM.

ARGVMEN'I'VM. The aryumenta (ὑποθέσεις, περιοχαῖ) prefixed to
the plays of Plautus and Terence are not the work of these authors
themselves. The Terence aryume‘nta, which are non-acrostic and consist
invariably of 12 lambio Senarii, were composed in the 2nd century ΑΛ).
by C. Sulpicius Apollinaris, the contemporary of Fronto and the teaeher
of Aulus Gellius and of the Emperor Pertinax. The authorship of the
Plautus arqumenta is unknown. They are of two kinds: (1) Non-acrostic,
for the Persa, Pseudolus and Stichus in the Ambrosian Palimpsest, and
for the Amphitruo, Aulularia, Mercator and Miles Gloriosus in the other
MSS„ the MSS. of the ‘ Palatine' family, (2) Acrostic, for all the plays in
the ‘Palatine’ MSS. (See Introd. i. ξ 15.) And there is this notable
difference between the two, that the Acrostic verses, unlike the Non-
acrostio, freely admit Hiatus, an admission due to the erroneous theory
that Hiatus was not avoided in the archaic poetry1. In the Acrostic
Argument before us therefore the Hiatus in v. 1 pugna Ι Hegionis, and
v, 5 inibi Ι emit, cannot of itself suggest that the reading of the MSS.
requires emendation. It is merely a pseudo—archaism. So is the spell-
ing of the Acrostic itself, CAPTEIVEI instead of CAPTIVEI. In the time of
Plautus the diphthong ez* was not used indiscriminately for any long
i-sound as it was in the time of Lucilius; but the simple vowel was used
for original i, the diphthong for ei (whether originally ei or ai or oi).
Thus on the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus (186 B.c.), an in-
scription two years earlier than the death of Plautus, dicerent (root deic-
of Gk. δείκ-νυμι etc.) is spelt DEICERENT, incideretis (root caid— of caido,
caedo, weakened to ceid-) is spelt mosiDEREms, foederati (with case-
ending -oi of Gk. ἅνθρωπ-οι etc. weakened to -ei> is spelt roInERArEI, but

 

1 We find on archaizing epitaphs of the Empire such lines as these (Anthol.
Lat. i. 108; an Iambic Acrostic) :—

Attonitus capita. minc uei-sorum Ι inspice,
(ibid. 436; a Dactylic Acrostic):
Littore Phocaico pelagi ui Ι exanimatae.
