14] PROLOGVS. 121

Ego me tua causa, ne erres, non rupturus sum.

14. cusa E erras Vl rupturus (ex rapt-) E

as ‘you are forcing the actor to beg for his bread, his occupation being
gone owing to the injury done to his vocal organs.' (Of. Ter. Phorm. 18
ille ad famem hunc α studio studuit reicere.) The way in which the
disturber was turning the histrio into a beggar, was that he was compelling

him to beg for a quiet hearing. We have the same idea in the concluding
passage of Ales Well that Ends WeZZ:

The king’s a beggar, now the play is done:
All is well ended, if this suit be won,
That you express content.

Quando has here the causal sense (cf. V. 886), a sense commoner in
Terence than in Plautus. Mendicarier. The Pass. Inf. in -z'er is not
found in the Dramatists except at the end of a line; that is to say, it is
an unusual form that is employed only through metrica] exigencies. With
a short antepaenultima, eg. derzsspier Men. 1006, it is almost unknown.
Mendicor, ‘to be a beggar,' the Deponent type (cf. philosopher, poetor),
occurs again in Vidal. fr. xv, (iii), malim moriri meos quam mendiearier;
but the Active mendico, ‘to beg,' was more in vogue, whether with an Aoo,
e.g. Amph. 1032 senecta aetate α me mendicas malum, or in absolute use,
e.g. Bacch. 508 Adeo 690 illam coyam usque ut mendicet —meus pater.
Cogis mendicarier. Reinkens (iiber Ace. eum Inf. bez‘ Plautus. Diisseld.
1887, p. 9) seems to speak of this construction of 0090 as unusual in Plautus
But cf. Pseud. 150, Epz‘d. 586.

14. Ne erres has the meaning ‘to keep you from misunderstanding
the plot of the play ' in the other occurrenoes of the phrase in pmlogues,
such as Trin. 4 Nunc, ne quis erret uestrum, paucis in uiam Dedueam,
«η’ quidem operam dare promittitis, Mil. 150 Et mox ne erretis, lzaec duarum
hodie uicem Et hine et illinc mulier feret inmgyinem, Men. 47 Ne mox· erretis,
iam nunc praedico prius .· Idem est ambobus nomen ¹(leminis fratribus. The
sense ‘do not delude yourself,' ‘do not imagine it‚' is expressed otherwise
in e.g. Rud. 1255 qu tibi daturus nihil sum, ne tu frustra sis (of. Capt. 854),
Poen. 527 Ne tu opinere, haud quisquam leodic nostrum curret per uias,
Cas. prol. 64 Is, ne expectetis, hodie in lzac comoedia In urbem non redibit.
But Terence so uses ne erres in Andr. 704 lmic, non tibi habeo, ne erres.
(In Most. 75 Ne cu hercle seems to be the right reading.) Rupturus
sum, ‘will crack my lungs’—with shouting‚ Cas. 809 dirumpi hymenaeum
cantando licen with running, Poen. 540 Tua causa nemo nostrorumst suos
rupturus ramites, Merc. 151 qui me rupi causa currendo tua. The Greek
word is διαρραγῆναι, eg. Lucian Char. 21 ἢν καὶ σὺ κεκραγώς· διαρραγῇς. On
the scansion rupturas sum (common before s-), sec Introd ii. ξ 3.
