order of the words) commends the unusual metaphor to Hegio in his heated
outburst, ‘you sower, you—‚ you hoer? That it is not the verbal noun
from sarcio, wilfully misunderstood by Tyndarus, is clear from the rest of
the line. Besides sarcio is not the Latin equivalent of Gk. ῥάπτω in this
metaphor (see note on sutelae v. 692). Messor adds the finishing touch
to sator and sartor. Ι doubt Morris' explanation ‘reaper of the crop of
punishment.'

662. The reading of the inferior MSS. is probably due to the fact that
in their common original ηοη was written with the usual contractiori oz, but
the suprascript line to indicate the contractior] was omitted. Hence Noo-
oatorem V, Hoccatorem E, Occatorem J. Audebas in the old sense of
audeo, ⁶ to have a mind to.' Non audes, ‘won't you ἵζ’ is a common formula
in requests, eg. Trao. 425 Non audes aliquid dare mihi munusculum? The
quotation of this line by N onius makes it certain that audebas is right, but
leaves a doubt regarding the order of the words3 for our MSS. of Nonius
have prius audebas dicere.

(See note on V. 324.)
664. Attat is Hermann's substitute for the scarcely metrical at of the
MSS. (cf. Aul. 52 At ut scelesta sola secum murmurat). We might also

suppose mi homo (which would be written in mediaeval MSS. milzo’) to
have been corrupted to milas.

665. Seruolum. Brix retains seruom of the MSS. with hiatus before
atque, a hiatus which seems scarcely legitimatc. The confusion of Diminu-
tives and Simple Nouns is so common in our MSS. as to warrant us here iu
reading seruolum (cf. Asin.. arg. 4 samolo edd„ seruo MSS). The Diminutive
form suits the deprecatory tone of Tyndarus, who feels that he has gone
too far in provoking Hegio (cf. v. 668).
