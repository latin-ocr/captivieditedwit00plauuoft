Ennius could imitate the Dactylic Hexameters of Homer without being
driven to that substitution of accented syllables for long syllables and

of unaccented for short which we see in English imitations of Greek
dactyls:

“This is the forest primeva-13 the murmuring pines and the hem-
locks.'’

But a stress-accent like the Latin could hardly be kept from asserting
itself in Roman poetry3 and, as a matter of fact, we find that the changes
which the Greek metres underwent in the hands of these Roman imitators
are, in many cases, clearly due to an attempt to reconcile the natural
stress-accent of the words with the ictus or metrical beat of the line.
The Dactylic Hexameters of Virgil and Ovid are hardly allowed any other
ending than (1) -vv‚ -Ξ, eg. moenia Romae, or (2) -ν, ν-ῑ, eg. maynus
Ap0Z303 the Dactylic Pentameters of Ovid are practically confined to the
ending ,Ἥκω -ν, υἱ, eg. praeciffl'tata forent, moenia mayna forent, the
last words being by preference enclitic or subordinate words, like tibi, tum,
erat, ficit, and the like. If we seek the reason why the Greek freedom
of choice of endings is abandoned by the Romans, we shall hardly find
a better one than the harmony of ictus and accent in the favoured endings‚
moe‘m'a Romae, msigmus A pallo, pracczpitdtaforent, modum mciyna forent, as
contrasted with the conflict of ictus ζ’) and accent ('') in the rejected end-
ings> e.g. ‘tc'inde'm cecz‘dc'stz'‚⁷ ‘praecipitat mallius? And side by side with the
quantitative verse of literary Rome there was always existing in Vulgar
Latin the old accentual poetry& of which we see traces in the rude songs
of soldiers at triumphs, eg. Suet. Caes. 80:

Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat qul-subegit Gallias,

a line which exhibits coincidence of accent and ictus, until at last with
the advent of Christianity the ‘poor man’s poetry' became the poetry of
the Church and the nation3.

5. In discussing the laws of the various dramatic metres in Plautus,
we have already noticed many instances of a regard for the natural
accentuation of worda such as (1) that modification of the Greek Dipody
law, by which spondees are freely allowed in the ‘even ² feet of lambio and
the ‘odd’ feet of Trochaic lines, but not frequently such a spondee as
-micz's in the line: '

1 The details of a similar treatment of the Sapphic stanza by the Roman
poets will be found in Brock, Sapphische strophe, M arienwerder, 1890, P. Eichhoff,
Horazisehe Doppezbau, dm· sappltischen Strophe, XVandsbecR 1895.

2 On the accentual nature of the old native Italian poetry, the Saturnian,
see American Journal of Plzilol09y‚ xiv. 139, 305.

3 It has been remarked that some of the lines of the Early Tragedians read
almost like anticipations of a Christian (accentual) hymn, e.g. Ennius Tray.
