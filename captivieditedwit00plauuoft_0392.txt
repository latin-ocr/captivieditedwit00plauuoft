362 PLAVTI OAPTIVI.

«Νη (5) Dactyl J-vv, (6) Proceleusmatic ύννν. There is no room for an
ictus like ύ-, to reproduce the accurate pronunciation of a disyllabic word
like fero, with short accented first syllable and long final syllable. This
discrepancy furnishes the opponents of Ritschl's dictum with their strongest
argument. How is it possible, they ask, to ascribe an accentual clement
to the verse of Plautus, when by the very nature of the metre used, the
accent of those numerous iambic disyllables of common use would resist
adaptation to the ictus or beat of the verse? Another argument, as
frequently used as this one, is that an Iambic line must end with an
Iambus (ν -'-), which implies an ictus on the final syllable of the line,
whereas an accent on the final syllable of a word is contrary to the Latin
practice; and these two arguments are regarded by many persons as con-
clusive. And yet the very fact that Plautus evidently takes the greatest
possible pains to overconie these two difficulties in the way of reconciling
ictus and accent, is one of the strongest proofs that he aimed at such
reconciliation. Let us examine his methods of dealing with these Iambus-
words.

(l) In the first place, he avails himself of the tendency of Latin
pronunciation to shorten their final syllable, a tendency which asserted
itself most strongly in those ending with a long vowel followed by -r, -t
(eg. ferer, ferat), and in many words which, ending in a long vowel, were
closely J'oined With other words in ordinary rapid utterance, eg. cave-scistis,
domi-resto, domc-vtsmb, dabo-plemam, dedi-plagam, dato-pldyam, cite-carre,
modb-ve'm, probe-fcinus. (On this Law of Breves Breviantes see Intr. ii. ξ 16.)

(2) Or secondly, he so places them in the sentence that their accent
is diverted from the first syllable, whether to the final, eg. bonaeque,
homene, bonam, bonae-sunt, malae-res, fidem-dat, or to a preceding word,
eg. labe—modo (like quc‘amodo), alique-mods), coctam-dabo.

(3) Thirdly, he elides their final vowel.

The usual place to which he assigns an Iambus-word, scanned as an
Iambus and with marked conflict of ictus and accent, is before a pause

in the sentence, especially in the first foot of an Iambic line, eg. Trin.
1—2:

A. Sequere hac me, gnata, ut munus fungaris tuom.
B. Sequ6r. sed finem fore quem dicam nescio,

where the disagreement would probably not be so marked. Before the
last Dipody of the line, eg. Aut. 581 A tque istuc aurum qu6d tibi concredi-
tumst, and (the most frequent situation) at the end of a line Iambic words
are preferred which would in ordinary uttcrance have no perceptible
accent, eg. tuom, ciba· in the lines quoted above, which would be as much
unaccented disyllables as the -sct'o of nescio. Cf. laic-modo, αἷίᾳαό-Ἰηοάο,
coctam-dam, factam-volo, &c It is rarcly that we find an Iambic word

at the end of a line to be an important word in the sentence, as in
Stich. 260:
