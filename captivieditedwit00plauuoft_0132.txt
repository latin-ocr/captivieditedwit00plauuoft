106 PLAVTI CAPTIVI.

The singularity of the play, its utter difference from the ordinary

entertainment of a holiday, is expressly acknowledged in the Prologue
(vv. 54 sqq.):

profecto expediet fabulae huic operam dare:

non pertractate facta est neque item ut ceterae,
neque spurcidici insunt uersus inmemorabiles:

hic neque periurus leno est neo meretrix mala, &c.;

and in the Epilogue (vv. 1029 sqq.):

spectatores, ad pudicos mores facta haec fabula est,...
huiusmodi paucas poetae reperiunt comoedias,

ubi boni meliores fiant. nunc uos, si uobis placet,

et si placuimus neque odio fuimus, signum hoc mittite,
qui pudicitiae esse uoltis praemium: plausum date.

That the new venture was not found too insipid for the taste of a Roman
audience we may infer from the traces of a later revival of the piece
(see note on v. 1022). In modern times it has found imitators¹‚ the best
known being Ariosto in his Suppositz', and Calderon in his Principe
Constante.

To its Greek original we can get no clue whatever. The various
hypotheses that have been put forward are so unsupported by evidence
as hardly to deserve mention2, and the discovery of a Greek papyrus-
fragment in Egypt may at any moment give us sure knowledge in the
room of vague surmise. We are equally destitute of information about the
relation of the Latin play to its original: whether the Latin text reproduces
the Greek with exactness, or whether other plays were drawn upon for
materials, we cannot say 3.

Of the date of the Latin adaptation we have more satisfactory indica—
tions in the jokes in vv. 90, 888, which suggest the year 193 B.c. (see
the notes to these lines) ; for allusions like these may fairly be supposed
to furnish something more than a mere ⁴ terminus a quo ’ for dating. The
facts referred to must have been contemporary, not removed by a lapse of
time; otherwise the allusions would lack point. The Captivi thus belonged
to the latter part of Plautus’ literary activity, if we are right in believing
this to have extended from about 204 B.c., the probable date of the Miles
Gloriosus, to the death of the poet in 184 Rc. (The action of the piece is
described in the preliminary notes to the several Acts and Scenes.)
