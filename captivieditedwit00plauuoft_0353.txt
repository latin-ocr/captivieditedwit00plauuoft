Act IV. Scene iii. (Trochaic Septenarii). Ergasilus is left on the
stage, master of the situation. In

“A temper known to those, who, after long
And wear-y expectation, have been blest
With sudden happiness beyond all hope‚”

he remains for a time
“with wise restraint
Voluptuous, fearless of a rival,'’

and reviews his prospect of a banquet. At last he dashes into the
house.

A minute or two would elapse before the next Scene. Brix suggests
that it may have been occupied by a musical interlude, as in the Pseudolus,
where at the conclusion of Act Ι. Sc. v. Pseudolus goes into the house with
the words:

Concedere aliquantisper hinc mi intro lubet,

Dum concenturio in corde sycophantias.

<Sed mox> exibo, non ero uobis morae:

Tibicen uos interibi hic delectauerit.
But I take it that a succession of crash and clatter from behind the stage,
where Ergasilus is supposed to bc &raging among the crockery in the
kitchen, would sufficiently occupy the attention of the audience in the
limited interval that would be necessary.

The Scene-heading in our MSS. is probably not the original Scene-
heading (see Introd. i. ξ 14). In other cases where a speaker in the
previous Scene is left on the stage, the word ims'ri'rrr is found in various
MSS. of the Palatine recens-ion, in Cz'st. 1. ii. LENA Rnsrirrr, in Bacch. 1v. iii.

901. Rem summam...cibariam‚ a parody of res summa publica (eg.
Mero. 986). Ergasilus, like Stasimus⁴ in the Trz'szzmmnus (ν. 482), puts food
quite on a par with politice (cf. vv. 153 sqq)

902. collos. See note on v. 357. The tit—bits which Ergasilus was
after were the ylcmdia (v. 915). Praetruncabo. Cf. ad V. 519.
