to the instructions which had been given in v. 115. By following the clue
supplied by the Pronouns we get, it seems to me, a much more natural
view of the situation than if we suppose Hegio at the words sequere kae me
iyitur to have led Philocrates away to another part of the stage, still
further removed from Tyndarus, and to have spoken the rest of the line,
eadem 690 ex lzoe quae uolo exquaesiuew, after an interval, while walking
back again towards Tyndarus. This supposition requires VV. 335 -6 to be
spoken by Tyndarus (with liujus for mei), the change in his tone being
produced by the exeitement caused by Hegio’s announcement. Seyffert
and Schoell believe that something has been lost in the MSS. after v. 292.
Igitur merely emphasizes the command, ‘follow me then? Cf. clz'c iyz'tur,
ayite igitur, &c Eadem (sc. opera), always with the Future or the
equivalent of the Future in Plautus. See note on v. 459. Exquaesi-
uero. On the Tense see note on v. 194. The spelling with ae is attested
for Aul. 800 by Priscian (i. p. 38, 1 Η. transit in i productam ut ‘quaera
inquiro, exquiro‚’ quamvis ‘emquaero' Plautus dixit in Aulularia.- ‘2' intro,
exquaew, sitne ita ut eqo praedico ’)‚ and is often found in our MSS. (For
statistics see Ritschl de Miller-io Popillium, p. 21.)

295. Gnatus. The usual spelling in Plautus seems to be quaties for
the Noun, ‘son,' and natus for the Participle‚ ‘born’ But the Participle
retains 9 in the phrase ,uenere 97zatus‚'e.g. v. -277 (see note), Aul. 778, &c.,
for the sake of the Alliteration. (Statistics are given by Hey in the
Supplement of the Jalzrhz‘tclzer fiir Plziloquie, 1891.)

296. Haec...eadem. Idem generally precedes ln'c in Plautus, always
in Terence. 'I'ua re feceris. The same phrase (or else tua re causa
facere) is found (with altered meaning) in Petron. 47 and 66, where re is
changed by editors to rem, as it is here to ar re. The Ablativc however
without a Proposition seems to be a genuine Old Latin idiom; and wc
may compare tua re feceris either with Stich. 463 augurium liae facit or
with the Classical phrase tua causa facere, &cn Mea refert will then be the
original form of the expression for ‘it is my intercst‚’ not meam rem fert nor
meae re (Dat.) fert 1101· meas νας fert. The emendation tua ea· re is not
altogether a happy one, since the position of ea· would bc abnormal;
