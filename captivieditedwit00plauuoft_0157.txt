36—39] PROLOGVS. 1 29

Quo pacto hic seruos suum erum hinc amittat domum.
Itaque inter se conmutant uestem et nomina3

Illic uocatur Philocrates, hic Tyndarus:

Huius illic, hic illius hodie fert imaginem.

36. Amsttat, class. dimittat. This is the literal sense of the word
and perhaps the most common sense in Plautus, ‘I send away’ (cz-mitto).
Next we have ⁴ I allow to go away,' eg. rudentem amittas, ‘let go the rope,’
Eud. 1031. Lastly the word is applied to cases where the removal of the
object is against one's will, ‘ I lose' (eg. vv. 23, 143 Quom quae in potestate
habuimus, ea amisimus). But the literal sense should always be assigned
to the word in Plautus where it is possible (see note on V. 655). Vitam
amittere, Asin. 611, means ‘to kill oneself,' not ‘to lose one's life!

38. Illic...hic. The speaker is standing beside the pretended Tyn-
darus, The Demonstratives hic, iste (istic), z'ZZe (illic) are used with
scrupulous correctness by Plautus : hie with reference to the First Personal
Pronoun‚ iste to the Second, ille to the Third. Thus we have sequere hae,
i.e. ‘by the route Ι am taking,’ abz' istac, i.e. ‘by the path before you‚'
while illae would refer to a route distant from both parties Of. Poen. 649
Α. Quis ln'c est? B. Nescimus nos quidem istum qui siet. An utterance
like per Itane dexteram te oro implies that the speaker takes hold of the
other’s hand. In the Menaechmi at v. 202, where Menaechmus says cape
tibi Itane (sc. pallam), the cloak is in Menaechmus’ hands; at v. 205,
where he remarks, Quattuor minis ⁶9¹0 emi istanc anno uxori meae, it has
passed into the hands of Erotium. The disposition of the actors &c. on
the stage may be detected from the alternation of lzz‘e, iste, ille in the
dialogue. (For fuller details see Bach in Studemund's Studien ii.)

39. Cf. Mil. 151 Et ltine et illinc mulier feret imaqinem, Amph. 141
seruos, cuius 690 fero lzcmc imayz'nem. Illic. This old Nom. form
illic, differing from ille as Acc. illunc from illum, is over and over again
changed to ille by scribes who know only the Adv. illic. The converse
change, from ille to illic, which some editors assume for this line, is very
unlikely. Besides, the incidence of the metrica] ictus which is secured by
the reading of the MSS. exaetly corresponds to the incidence of stress in
the utterance of a phrase like this, lucius illic hie iltius. The last word
will have that disyllabic pronunciation which is indicated in several lines
of Plautus, eg. Epid. 717 A. Ain tu te illius inuenisse filiam? B. Inueni,
