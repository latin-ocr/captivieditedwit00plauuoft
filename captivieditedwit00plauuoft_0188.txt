160 PLAVTI CAPTIVI. [153--155

Quia nunc remissus est edendi exercitus.
HEG. Nullumne interea nactu’s, qui posset tibi
Remissum quem dixti imperare exercitum? 155

154. ERG. libri: Hm. Lambinus, qui etiam insequentibus personas distribuit
‘aliquot librorum antiquorum auctoritatem secutus ³ (fort. T siynificatur)
Nillumne V1 155. dixit libri (corr. V2J)

Bacch. 630 bonum habe (inimum. The phrase bono animo 63 (at the end of
a line &c through metrical exigencies anim bono es) seems to have been
pronounced as a single word, with the accent normally on the first (b6n(o)-
am'mo's), but occasionally on the second syllable (b0n(o)-dnim0’s>‚ (Amph.
1131, Mil. 1342, Ter. Haut. 821). The encouraging fact, the prospect of
recovering Philopolemus, is mentioned below (v. 167). Huic is usually
explained as uentri, Ergasilus being supposed to lay his hand on his stomach
at this word, as the thief holds up his hand in Epzssd. 10:

A. Oorpulentior uidere atque habitior. B. Huic gratia.

(Of. Prin. 541 tam glabrae, em quam liaeo est memus), or as Sannio lifts his
finger in Ter. Adel. 162:

Tu quod te posterius piu'ges, hanc iniuriam mihi nolle
Factam esse, huius non faciam.

(Of. Donat. ad loc: ‘liuius' autem δεικτικὸν est,· aut enim stzssulam aut
floccum noverat aut summum dzyzftmm, or as the old man points to his white
hair in Bacch. 1102 Perii, leoc seruom meum non nauci faeere esse ausum!
But kuic may have its common sense of mz'lzz‘3 and it is perhaps more in
keeping with the situation, if we take huie illud dolet to mean ‘it is a real
grief to me,’ and suppose that Ergasilus, instead of going on to add ‘that
your son has been captured,' by a sudden impulse tells the honest truth
and substitutes ‘that the eating levies have now been disbanded’ (cf. note
on v. 135). 011 the hiatus at the change of speaker and after eheu see
Introd. ii. ξ 42. Dolet, Inipers. See note 011 v. 928.

153. Quia, freq. after verbs of the emotions, eg. ν. 203, Epid. 107
Idne pudet te qaia captiuam 9671676 proyrmtam bono ln praeda es mercatus?
Remissus est exercitus, We have another metaphor from the same
source in Oz'st. 58 Nol ι’, obsecro, lacrumis tais mi exercitam imperare, ‘do not
by your tears call out my c‹›11ti11gent,² sc. of weeping. The common mili-
tary term remitto recurs in Εμίᾱ. 206 α Zeyz'ww omnes remissi sunt domum.
Edendi exercitus, a curious use of the Genitivc of the Gerund. The
nearest parallel is in the (un-Plautino ¹2) prologue of the Poenulus (v. 34):
Domum sermones fabulandi conferant.

154. Posset. On the Mood see note on v. 1033.
