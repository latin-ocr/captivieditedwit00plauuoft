34¹². Bitschl’s theory that stricter laws of Prosody were observed in some
metres than in others can hardly stand. It is true that in Cretic and Bacchiae
passages the Law of Breves Breviantes has very limited operation, mainly
because the nature of these metres was adapted for iambus-words rather than
pyrrich-words (iii. §§ 27—13, 36); and in Anapaestic lines the scansion of a Cretic
word as a Dactyl under this law is as common as it is rare in the dialogue
metres, whose nature was not adapted for dactyl—words (iii. ξ 7). But apart from
these peculiarities of technique and apart from the necessary divergence of the
style and vocabulary of lyric passages from those of the ordinary dialogue-
portione, there is nothing to warrant the distinction of ‘zahme' and ‘wilde
Rhythmen' in Plautus (See Klotz, GrumlziigJe, p. 17.)

Ε. Hiatus.

35. Cicero, speaking of the earlier Roman poets, says (Orator
xlv. 152): Sed Graeci viderint3 nobis, ne si cupiamus quidem,
distrahere voces conceditur. indicant orationes illae ipsae horridulae

Catonis, indicant omnes poetae praeter eos. qui, ut versum facerent,
saepe hiabant, ut Naevius:

uos, qui Ι accolitis Histrum fluuium atque algidam,
et ibidem :

quam nfimquam uobis Graii Ι atque barbari,

at Ennius semel (al. saepe): ⁴ Scipio Ι inuicte‚' et quidem nos: ‘hoc
motu radiantis Etesiae Ι in vada ponti.' hoc idem nostri saepius
non tulissent, quod Graeci laudare etiam solent.

It has been suggested that the loss of -cl from the termination
of Ablatives Singular would leave an appearance of hiatus, a false
appearance, to a critic of Cicer-ds time, just as the disuse of the
Digamma gave Alexandrian critics a wrong impression of Homer's
tolerance of hiatus. No doubt a line like the Saturnian of Naevius :

noctu Troiad exibant capitibus opertis,

would, if written with the current form Troia, instead of the form
actually used by Naevius, give the impression that Naevius had
left an hiatus between Troia and mathana 3 and it is conceivable that
Cicero’s verdict is in some part based on a misapprehension of this
kind. But it is impossible to explain it all away in this fashion.
The instances which Cicero quotes are not instances of Ablative
forms followed by seeming hiatus. And Abl. forms with final d
would be found only in the earliest poctry, the poetry of Livius and
