of pages of some such content as this would be required for this amount of
the text.

The other two minuscule MSS„ which eontain the last twelve
plays, are closely related to each other. They are both direct copies
of one and the same original (Pon), and that original itself a copy
of P, but by no means so faithful a copy as Β. They are :—

6. (C) the Codex Decurtatus, now in the Palatine collection at
Heidelberg (shelf-mark Pal. Lat. 1613), but formerly in the Abbey
of Freising near Munich. It is written in minuscules of the eleventh
century and contains only the last twelve plays 3 though the fact
that the first quaternion was originally marked xvii, the second xviii,
and so on, shews us that it was copied from an original which con-
tained all the plays. C has 26 lines to the page.

7. (D) the Codex Ursinianus, in the Vatican Library (shelf-

„ mark Vat. lat. 3870), written in minuscules of the eleventh century.

It was this MS. whose discovery (in some part of Germany) at the
Renaissance caused so much enthusiasm among scholars, who now
for the first time became acquainted with the last twelve plays of
Plautus (Bitschl, Proleyowzena, xxxii. 3 Opusc. V. 296). All MSS. of
Plautus written subsequent to its discovery reproduce its text of these
plays in an edited form known as the ‘Itala recensio' (Bitschl, Pro-
Zeqy. le. sqq.; Opusc. ii. 1 sqq.) D contains also some of the first
eight plays <see below). It has, like C, 26 lines to the page3 and
this number has been assumed for POD on the strength partly of this
coincidence, partly of other indications.

8. Of our manuscript authorities for the first eight plays two
have been already lnentioned3 B, containing all the eight, and D,
containing the first three and capt. 1—503¹. But the relation of

· B to D in the first eight plays and for the last twelve is different.

For the last twelve B stands at a stage nearer to the archetype
than D, at the sanie stage as the lost original (ΡΨ) of D. But for
the first eight B and D seem to be as closely related as G and D
for the last twelve, both being immediate copies of one and the
