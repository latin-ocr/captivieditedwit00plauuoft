Cure. 567 prinsquam te huic meae machaerae Ι obicio, mastigia

Bacch. 612 petulans, proteruo, iracundo Ι animo, indomito, in-

Mil. 1055 exprome benignum ex te ingenium, Ι urbicape, oc-

(For a fuller list of examples see Klotz, Grundzu‘qe, pp. 142 sqq.
Syllaba Anceps is found at the same place; see above, ἓ 33.) This
is not rea] Hiatus of the kind referred to by Cicero. All that these
scansions imply is that to Plautus these long lines were as much
pairs of short lines as anything else, and that, e.g.‚ Eud. 388 might
be written :
Sed quid flet? Ego dicam tibi:
hoc sese excruciat animi,

just as we may write :

Of all the days that's in the week
Ι clearly love but one day 3

And that's the day that comes between
The Saturday and Monday,

as four short or as two long lines.

Ritschl, however, in his opposition to the lax theory of previous editors, that
Hiatus was adniissible in any circumstances whatever in Plautus, set his face
against even this Metrical Hiatus, so far as he could. His views were for a time
accepted by his pupils, the editors of the large Teubner edition, so that in their
earlier volumes the text has been systematically altered in avoidance of a
supposed illegitimate hiatus of this kind. In the small Teubner edition these
alterations have been discarded. Some details regal-dmg the extent to which
two closely connected words are allowed this Metrica] Hiatus, eg. molestalles,
will be found in Brock, Quaest. Gramm. 172.

Klotz (Grundziiye, pp. 165 sqq., 203 sq.)‚ although he rightly denies the
possibility of Plautus allowing hiatus at the mere caesura of an Iambic Senarius,
thinks that ancient editors of Plautus allowed it, and that lines like Aac. 399 :

congrum, muraenam Ι exossata fac sicnt (υλ. c. m. exdorsua, quantum potest),

are ‘doctorcd’ lines, os which hc finds some 70 or 80 examples in Plautus.
Seyffert (Ber-I.. Phil. Woch. 1891, pp. &78 sqq.) has succeeded in throwing strong
doubt on this theory.
