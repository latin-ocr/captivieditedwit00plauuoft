‘ The tender reverence of the treatment
and the imaginative beauty of the writ-
ing have reconciled us to the daring of
the conception, and the conviction is
forced on us that even so exalted a sub-
ject cannot be made too familiar to υς,
provided it be presented in the true spirit
of Christian saith. The amplifications

of the Scripture narrative are osten con-
ceived with high poeticinsight, and this
“Dream of the World's Tragedy¹’ is
a lofty and not inadequate paraphrase
of the supreme climax of the inspired
narrative.'—Dublin Rcview.

THE SORROWS OF SATAN.
Fortietlz Edition.

‘A very powerful piece of work. . . . 'che
conception is magnificent, and is likely
to win an abiding place within the
memory of man. . . . The author has
immense command of language, and a
limitless audacity. . . . This interesting
and remarkable romance will live long
after much of the ephemeral literature
os the day is forgotten. . . . A literary
phenomenon . . . novel, and even sub-
lime.’——W. T. STEAD in the Review
ofReviews.
