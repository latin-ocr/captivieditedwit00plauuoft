perye tu quantum ualet Tuorum pedum pernicitas. For free men such haste
in the public streets was unseemly. Of. Poen. 522:

Liberos homines per urbem modico magis par est gradu
Ire: seruile esse dico festinantem currere.

The god Mercury himself condescende to play the part of a servus currens
in the Amphitruo (V. 986) ε

Nam mihi quidem hercle qui minus liceat deo minitarier
Populo, ni decedat mihi, quam seruolo in comoediis?

Ille nauem saluam mmtiat aut irati aduentum senis:

Ego sum Ioui dicto audiens, eius iussu nunc huc me adfero.

Other examples in Plautus are the parasite in the‘Cm·cchz'0 (ΙΙ. 111), the
slave in the Mercator (Ι. 11.), the page in the Stichus (ΙΙ. 1.).

780. Aeternum...cibum. Cf. v. 897. The Adj. probably means ‘for
one’s lifetime' rather than ‘for ever! It recurs illest. 195 stulta es plane,
Quae illum tibi aeternum putes fore amicum et beneuolentem (of. ib. 225
illum amatorem cibi proprium fectzcrmn z'n uita). There is no reason for
believing it ever to be pronounced as a quadrisyllable (aeviternus) in
Plautus. Adepturum. See note on v. 483. Ergasilus’ hope is
ultimately fulfilled (V. 897).

Act IV. Scene ii. HegiO, unobserved by Ergasilus, who is engaged
in tucking up his ‘pallium' in preparation for running, comes out of the
house in a state of great dejection. His song, in monotonous Bacchiae
Tetrameters, relieved only by an lambio Dimeter Oatalectic at V. 784, is
in marked contrast to the gay Canticum of Act ΙΙΙ. Sc. ii. The sight of
Ergasilus in the part of a ‘currens servus' rouses him from his despondency,
and in the course of a lively, not to say boisterous, dialogue with the excited
Parasite he learns the welcome news of his son's return. He hurriedly
gives Ergasilus ‘carte¹ blanehe’ in his kitchen and hasten-s off to the
harbour. The prevailing metm, after the opening Bacchiae Canticum,
is the Trochaic Septenarius‚ but the recognition by Ergasilus of Hegio, the
incident which changes the whole situation, is marked by a variation of
Iambic (VV. 833, 8:34, 837) with Orotie lines (vv. 835, 836). With this
delineation of the ‘currens servus' may be compared the similar soenes
mentioned above, Cure. 11. iii., Mero. 1. ii., ,Stia-lc. 11. i.
