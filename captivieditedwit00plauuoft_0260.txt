praeuerti decet, Mero. 376 Rea· mandatae omnis sapientis primum praeuorti
decet. The Adverb is otiose (see note on V. 321). This use of praeuortor
is common, eg. v. 1026, Cist. 781 Praenorta’ hoe certumst rebus aliis omnibus.
Hegio leaves the stage by the right-hand door (p. 112), accompanied by
Philocrates, in quest of the praetor (v. 450), from whom he is to get the
passport.

Act III. Scene 1. (Trochaic Septenarii.) Ergasilus enters by the
right-hand door of the stage, having returned from the forum (v. 478),
where he has sought in vain for a more attractive invitation to dinner
than Hegio's. After a comical narration of his unhappy experienees, he
leaves (by the left-hand door) for the harbour.

This scene, according to the tradition of the MSS„ was a ‘'diverbium‚’
not a ‘canticimi,⁷ i.e. was spoken without musical aecompaniment.

461. Ipse. The form ipsus is normal in conjunctior] with the Refiexive
Pronoun or Possessive Adj. ; and perhaps ipsus is the original reading here,
which has been changed to ipse, just as in Τνίη. 262 fuyat ipsus se α suo
contum, the true form ‘ipsu-se, preserved by the Ambrosian Palimpsest, has
been changed in the Palatine MSS. to ipse. But there is evidence that
ipse was occasionally used in this connexion, for it is required by the
Metre in Bacch. 417 Iam fiderit tempus, czim sese etiam ipse aderit.- more'm
θεν-αις· (of. v. 560 ef this play). It is therefore perhaps safer to keep the
reading of the MSS. here. For the rhythm ipse? sibi cf. illes sibi Stich.

462. Est miserior qui...quaerit. We find the Subj. in Mero. 700
M [serior mulier me προῄει, necfuit, Tales uiro quae nupserint.

463. Ille miserrimust, probably to be scanned Hae) misero-imme,
though a dactyl of the sorni llle mi- would be tolerated in the first foot
(lntrod. iii. ξ 16). The scansion miserrimus-t is unnecessary here and is in
itself extremely doubtful <l1itrod. ii. δ 23). The defective metre of the line
