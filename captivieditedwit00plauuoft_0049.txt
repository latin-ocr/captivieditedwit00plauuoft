succession of Iambic Monometers of the type uuLo—). But the
Law of Breves Brevi-antes seldom operates with a final s (below,
g 19), so that etas, dats (cf. Gk. θεῶν, monosyllabic), etc. are more
likely scansions than ἔόε, (Ζέὄε. And since Lucilius and Lucretius
exhibit in their dactylic verse the scansion (Edem, where ‘ffidemss
in itself a most unlikely form, is definitely excluded by the metre,
there is no reason for not ascribing the sanie scansion to Plautus.
Eodem in Poen. 895, for example:

eodem quo sor5r illius altera Anterastilis,

can hardly be treated differently from, let us say, eodem in Lucil.

At the same time it must be allowed that these supposed contracted forms
lack definite metrical proof. Monosyllabic 50, for example, is not found at the
end of a line or hemistich (cf. iii. ἓ 9), where its monosyllabic scansion would be
put beyond possibility of doubt. The metre generally leaves us the option of
scanning ἑὸ, &c.‚ or ἑῖ), 810. Stil] ἀΐίἵιε] seems preferable in Bacch. 650

ἀῶ and sffi in Stich. 2²² and 2b (if these Dochmii conform to the type of their

neighbours Ξ - - v ν =):

(for dii} cf. Mil. 628 ?); and on the other hand ειῖἲει rather than sffisc in the
Choriambic line, Cas. 629:

eripite isti gladium quae suist impds animi,

τηέἄνη rather than mffim in the Glyconic, Cure. 155. Before a vowel (ξ 40) 1110
pyrrich scansion is indubitable, eg. 77ῑέαέ 10 Amph. 1106 (Trochaic Septenarius) ;

non dubito quin meae uxori latae suppetiae sient.

On the whole it seems most likely that the three scansions ἔῦ, ἔὸ and 55 were
1010101011, just as three scansione seem to have been tolerated in the Dative

singular of the same Pronoun, ἒῑ, &i and Ξῖ (also ‘ez' ?) (above, ἓ 6). The same
doubt exists regarding the scansion of ‹Iiutz‘us (eg. Trin. 685), the by-form

increased by the possibility of a reduced form 7710- for mea, so· for sum, dcc„ 011

di (from dini ‘.>) and dis (from divis ?) being the forms preferred (for details see
Abraham, Strui. Plaut. p. 204). The common phrase di deaeque is normally
trisyllabic (dffie). Similarly i and is (cf. class. islam and isdem) are the current
forms of the Nom. and Dat.‚ Abl. Plur. of the Pronoun, though εἳ, eis are
occasionally found, eg. Mero. 369. (Havet however in Rev. Philoloyie, 1892,
