same original (ΡΒΠ), an original which probably had, like PCD, 26
lines to a page (ξ 7), and which may have been the first part of PCD. *²3-

9. The text of D is precisely of the same value as the text of B
in the earlier plays (see Gillespie in Harvarsl Stzcdies ix. 109). But
throughout the first eight plays B has received certain corrections, 2,
which Ι propose to denote by the symbol B3. These corrections, unlike
the corrections in the first four of the last twelve plays, and unlike
those corrections which are properly marked Β2 111 the first eight,
have been taken, not from the common original (PBD) of B and D,
but from another MS. of great value, which contained various lines
(eg. Aul. 454) that had been omitted in PBD, and which preserved
the genuine reading in numerous cases of corruption in PBD. This
MS. was however a descendant of the same archetype as PBD, and
may indeed have been the actual original from which PBD was
copied¹. If PBD and POD were the first and second half of one MS„
it is conceivable that the source of the B3-corrections was the first

half of the MS. P.

It is plain that the scribes of 13, when beginning the task of copying, had an
original which contained only the first eight plays. They began their work on
what is now fol. 9, and on the reverse side of that leaf wrote a title: in hoc
volumine continentur comediae plauti numero viii, with a list of the first eight
plays (Amph.—-Epid.). When the last twelve plays were added and the Querolus ,
(a late imitation of Plautus) prefixed by the same staff of scribes, that title and
list were erased, and on the first page of the quaternion which was prefixed with
the Querozus a new title was written 2 In hoc volumine continentvr comediae plauti
numero xxi, with a full list of the plays beginning with the Qum-olas (hence
‘ twenty-one‚‘ not ‘twenty’), and with a slight break in the list between the
Epidicus and the Bacchides. The nature of B may be explained on the hypo-
thesis that the scribes began with an original (1³⁸⁰) which contained the first
eight plays only; that a new MS. (P), containing all twenty plays (perhaps with
the Querela-s· prefixed), and being itself the original from which pm> had been
copied, was brought into requisition for the correction of Β; that from this new
MS. the last twclve plays (with the Querolus) were copied, and the old title with
the list of eight plays was replaced by a new title with a full list. For the
second part of the ΜΞ. 110 fresh original of equal importance was available, and
the various correctors of this part used the actual original from which the copy
was made2.

¹ Here are some indications of its relationship to Pm'. It seems to have had
in Asin. 266 obsca‘e‘icauih which was also the reading of Pffl' (cf. obscacuauit B,
obsceuauit D, obscaeruauit 12⁸3 see bel‹›w); Aul. 537ααιείιιίιὲι 111 Pffl‘audliw (cf. di
audiui 139⁸, di D); Cas. 634 ηεσαῑῐαηιαὸο, 111 Pffl' necadamabo. And it sharcd a
large number of corrupt readin *s with ΡΜ), eg. Cas. 347 (ef.J0uru.1²hil.
xxv21 ἓξὲξ-,111 found also indications that they occasionally used the original
(1¹⁰⁰) of C and D (see the Preface to his edition of the Miles Gloriosus).
