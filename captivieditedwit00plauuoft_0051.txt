11. PROSODY. 29

cf. Nera} Gen.‚ Epid. 36). But qratiis in Oapt. 408 (εμπ), qaudiis Capt. 840
should probably be scanned as dactyls‚ under the Law of Breves Breviantes (ξ 25),

not as spondees. Similarly in the Anapaestic Cantica such scansions as αῑινέᾶ,

gratiis, 971111κᾶ (abl.) are now generally discarded for aurea (Cure. 139), gratiis,
qratia (see Klotz, Grund2i1'9e‚ pp. 281 sqq). (On vffitus of Hor. and similar
scansions in other than dramatic poets, see Luc. Mueller Res Metr.2 p. 299.
Ennius, Ann. 443, 91 M.‚

hic insidiantes uigflant, partim requiescunt,
auium, praepetibus sese pulcrisque locis dant,

either uses Synizesis or allows an Anapaest in place of a Dactyl.) The

shortening of (1ἶέ under the Law of Breves Breviantes (ἓ 16) 111 Pers. 260 is
doubtful (Leo scans ess(c) die3 cf. ξ 14). Of the curicus suppression of i in
Lucretius' semine 5r(i)undi (ii. 991) 110 certain trace is found in Plautus (cf.
Poen. 1055, Stich. 165).

The classica] Latin forms are σᾶμ’, coegi. Plautus uses occasionally the
trisyllabic coepi (cf. Lucr. iv. 617), e.g. in the Bacchiae lines, Cas. 701, Uist. 687 ;

nam quor non ego id perpetrem quod coepi?
sed pergam ut coepi tamen, quaeritab03

though the disyllabic coEyi in Bacch. 981 is very doubtful:

optumus sum orat6r3 ad lacrumas hominem coegi castigando
(coegi hominem MSS.; h. adl. 00. Ritschl).

The same divergence from the classical form of such compounds is seen in the
contractione cii-“gree of Pacuvius 48 (cf. 345) R„ conestat (for cohonestat) of Accius
445 R„ dffisculer Cas. 136 (but deamata Truc. 703), dle. (cf. Luc. Mueller, Res
Metr.² p. 294). The trisyllabic form Clffistrata (Cas, 393, 541, dxc.) is taken from
the Greek.

As regards intervocalic h the contracted pronunciation (not necessarily
the spelling) of cohibeo, prohibeo, as well as of debeo, praebeo (praehibeo), is
argued from the entire absence of an incidence of ictus on the second syllable.
We find the ictus adhibeam, exhibeam, but never prohibeam, cohibeam. (For
details see Abraham, Studia Plautina, p. 229.) Mt for mihi is to be found (unlike

mk} for mei, me‘o for mco) at the end of a line or hemistich where only mono-
syllabic pronunciation is possible, eg. Asin. 614 tu uita cs mi (cf. Most. 175, 871).
Ritschl (Opusc. ii. 5883 v. 514) laid down 1110 rule that the form mi was not
used by the Dramatists before a consonant, except occasionally in the thesis,
while in non-dramatic verse (Ennius' Annals, Lucilius‘ Satires, dcc.) it might be
used in the arsis 100. Ritschl however modified his views afterwards and came
to acquiesce in e.g. mi latitabat Trin. 927. The scribes of our Mss. seem to have
made a rule of writing mihi for the Personal and ‘mi for the Possessive Pronoun
(Voc.)‚ so that the manuscript evidence does not go for much. Ritschl's restriction
may be safely disregarded3 in particular, we may write mi in Bacchiae Verse‚
where the pyrrich scansion of iambus-words 15 1101 favoured by Plautus (ξ 34“).
Disyllabic nihil is generally disallowed in Plautus, because there is no example
of the word at the end of a line, where the metro would necessitate this form.
But 11 occurs in Terence, Haut. 896, l’horm. 940 1——
