the Preface to his edition of the play, p. xiii.) The names of three ‘lorarii'

ιὙμεῖς γὰρ ἀλλήλους ἀεὶ χλευάζετ’, οἶδ’ ἀκριβῶς·

Donatus (ad Andr. Ι. iii. 21> says of the slave-names in Comedy:
semper autem nomina comicorum servorum aut a nationibus sunt indita,
ut ‘Mysis‚' ‘Syrus‚' aut ex accidentibus ut ‘ Lesbia,' velut ebriosa, a Lesbo
insula, quae est ferax suavissimi eandidissimique vini, aut a moribus et
vernilitate, ut ‘Pseudolus’ aut ex negotiO, ut ‘Chrysalus‚' aut ex qualitate

‘Stalagmus' belongs to the category ‘ex qualitate corporis.²

The scene is laid in Aetolia, a fact which has to be expressly stated to
the audience (v. 94 Nam Aetolia haec est), since the conventional locality
was Athens. On the stage, which represents a street (v. 795 home plateam)
before the house of Hegio (v. 96 Senis qui hic habitat), stand two young
prisoners of war (v. 1 Hos quos uidetis stare lzz'c captiuos duos) bound
together by heavy chains (v. 113 catenas...mai0res quibus sunt iuncti).
One of them, Tyndarus, is supposed to be a man of 24 years (v. 980) ; the
other, Philocrates, of about the same age (v. 20). By the convention of
the Roman stage the town was supposed to lie on the right side, the
harbour on the left side from the spectators. The play begins with a
prologue, spoken probably by one of the younger actors (of. Ter. Haut.
prol. init).
