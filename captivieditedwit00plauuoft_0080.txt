III. METRE.

Relation to Greek Models.

1. To understand Plautine Metre we must regard it as the
last stage in the development of Greek Dramatic Metre. Its
differences from its model are for the most part cases of progression
along the same line as was followed on Greek soil, though some are
due to a divergence on Latin soil, caused by the different character
of the Latin and Greek languages. The free admission of trisyllabic
feet (ξ 7) into the Iambic and Trochaic lines of Plautus, as com-
pared with those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, is merely a continuation
of the course taken by the Greek Comedians themselves 3 the removal
of the restrictions of this or that Metre to the expression of this or
that feeling (g 4), and the stichic use (ie. the use in continuous
passages) of some metres (eg. Bacchiae, ξ 26, versus Reiziani‚ ξ 49)
which were originally employed merely as occasional variations‚—all
this marks the last stage reached in the development of Greek
Metre, a stage reached probably by the Alexandrian Dramatic
writers. On the other hand, the great regard paid to the natural
accent of words is something quite alien to Attio poetry, and is a
result of the transference of Greek Metre to a country where the
accent was an accent of stress and not an accent of pitch or tone,
like the Greek (Lat. szy. iii. ἓ l). The complete avoidance of such
an incidenee of ictus as trahere, retrahere, detraIzcEre, and the partial
avoidance of perdere, disperdere is due to the harsh effect produced
by the clash of the natural accentuation⁷ trahere, perdere with such
an ictus (see Appendix).

2. The Roman Tragedians found niodels for cantica in the
choruses of their Greek originale. Thus Ennius' Anapaests in the
opening canticum of his Iphi-<fania are a reproduction of those of
Euripides (quoted in ,ξ 21> ; though we cannot suppose the Bacchiae
passage in his Thyestes (vv. 303—ss R.) to have had any parallel in a
Greek Drama of the fifth or even fourth century (g 26). But Plautus
cannot have been indebted for his cantica to Menander or any other
poet of the New Conledy. The chorus, with its strophio and anti-
