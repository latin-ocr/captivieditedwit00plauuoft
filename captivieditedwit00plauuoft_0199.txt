was originally declined siem, sies, siet (cf. Greek ἐ(σ)ιήν, ε’(ο-)ιής, ε’(σ)ίη(τ),
simus (older -os), sitis (older -es)‚ sient. In course of time -i- of simus,
sitis took the place of -ie- of siem, &c., so that the declension became
sim, sis, sit, simus, sitis, sint. In the time of Plautus the older forms are
in process of disappearing. We find them chiefly employed ‘metri causa‚'
at the end of the line or hemistich, as here. Sometimes the MSS. retain
the old spelling, where the metre requires the new form, eg. Amph. 979.

194. Dixeram (in V. 126). On the tense see note on v, 17. Here we
must supply ‘ before Ι met Ergasilus) Ire dixeram (see note on
v. 365). Iero, with first syllable long. We generally write {uero and
iero, but I prefer to keep to the spelling of the MSS. here, in view of
Donatus’ note on Ter. Adel. 1. i. 2 ‘ierant' producte i pronuntiando, qaod
nos addita v ‘iverant’ dicimus. (Cf. Stich. 484.) It seems difficult to draw
any sharp line between the Fut. Perf. and the Fut. in Plautus. Metrical
considerations determine the use of the former as much as anything else,
its usual place being at the end of the line or hemistich (cf. vv. 293, 340,
494). For its equivalence with the Fut. cf. Asin. 280 Eros in obsidione
linquet, inimicum animos auxerit, Trin. 463 Oculum 690 ecfodiam tibi, si
uerbum addideris, beside Rud. 1401 Vapulabis, uerbum si addes istuc unum.

Act ΙΙ. Scene i. The chief lorarius comes out of the house with
his assistants (followed by some of the other slaves, v. 211> to execute the
orders given by Hegio (vv. 110 sqq.). The opening passage (vv. 195 sqq.)
is spoken while the change of fetters is being made. In accordance with
the policy of kind treatment enjoined by Hegio (v. 114), Tyndarus, who is
playing the part of the master, asks and obtains permission to have a
private conversation with Philocrates, his pretended slave, in which the
scheme for Philocrates' release is discussed.

The metrical arrangement of this ‘mutatis modis canticum' (Oretics,
Bacchiacs, &c.) is made diffie-ult by the fact that the archetype (P) of our
MSS. had not observed with care the division of the lines in lyric passages.
The arrangement of the Cantica according to the method of colometry
prescribed by the Alexandrian editors of the Greek Dramatists (see Introd.
i. ξ 13) 15 followed in the Ambrosian Palimpsest and was also followed
apparently in the proto-archetype (ΡΑ) of the other MSS. In one copy
of this last, the Codex T urnebi (Τ), the division of the lines was accurately
rendered, but in that copy (P) from which our extant MSS. have been
derived, it was abandoned over and over again for the sake of saving space.
While the division of long lines was, as a rulo, retained, short lines were
often written together, the only trace of the previous arrangement being
here and there a capital letter in the middle of the new line, at the place
where the old line had bcgun (see Introd. iii. ξ 5). Thus in the case of
Cantica, like this one, for which wc have neither the evidence of the
Ambrosian Palimpsest nor of the Codex T urnebi, one cannot be sure when
