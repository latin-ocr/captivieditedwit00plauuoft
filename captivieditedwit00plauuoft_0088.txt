Plautus and Terence, and in many of the cases where they occur
some special effect is aimed at. Thus Men. 750, with its scanty
Caesura, suits the staccato tone of a surprised question:

negas nouisse me? negas patrem meum?
as also ilffost. 946 (cf. Bacch. 257):
Flrus hic noster potat. Erus hic uoster potat? Ita loquor3

and Prin. 1094 is conxically appropriate to the tone of reproach:
O Callicles, Ο Callicles, O Callicles 3
there is dogged obstinacy in the rhythm of. Pers. 373 :

dicat quod quisque uult: ego de hac sententia
non demouebor 3

while the impatience of the speaker is expressed by the defective
rhythm of Asin. 325, a Trochaic Septenarius:

quin rem actutum edisseris? cupio malum nanciscier.

Sometimes the absence of Caesura is necessitated by the exigencies
of fitting long words into a line, eg. Aul. 510 flammdrii, uioldrii,
carindrii.

For fuller details, see Klotz, Grvencleye, pp. 187 sqq. Seyffert in Berl.

Philol. Wochenschij't xviii. 977 points out how often a caesura-less Iambic
senarius has Diam-esis at the fourth foot, eg. Stich. 300:

secundas fortunas decent Η superbiae.

Another matter in which the Roman Dramatists are more careful

than the Greek is their avoidance of a nionosyllabic ending of
Iambic and Trochaic lines.

For details, see Klotz, erudziigye, pp. 188 sqq„ 248. He points out that
Terence ancl Ennius (not Plautus) are favourable to a monosyllabic ending after
elision, eg. Eun. 859 : consei‘uam? uix me contineo, quin inuolem in (capillum,
ἄτα). (Cf. Men.. 592.) Full details rcgarding Terence's practice are given by
Fabia in Rev. Philoloffie, xvii. 32.

Leo seems right in his protest (Plaut. Cant. 8) against the attribution to
Plautus of such metrical ⁸ barbarisms' as ⁶ Iambic’ (or Trochaic or Anapaestic)
‘Ti-modies) ·P0ntap0dies‚⁷ etc„ ‘ brachycatalectic' and ‘hypercatalectic’ lines,
and the like.

Still it must be allowed that the introduction of Spondees into
the ‘ even' feet of Iambic and the ‘odd' of Trochaic lines spoils the
rhythmical effect of these lines in the Latin Drama. It was eschewed
by inore fastidious imitators of Greek Iambics, like Catullus and his
successor-s (except Phaedrus). (For details see Luc. Mueller, Res
Meto-5³ pp. 524 sqq.)
