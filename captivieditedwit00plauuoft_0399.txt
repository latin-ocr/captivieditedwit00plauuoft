APPENDIX. 369

analogous took place in Latin (and I see no reason for doubting it) an ictus
like that of senui-me, ‘ save me,' in Cure. 628:

Phaedrome, obsecro, serua-me, δῖα,

cannot be quoted as an example of the conflict of ictus and aocent. Τ110
acoent of the Imperative standing alone would be se‘rva, but the word-
group serva-me would take the same accentuabion as a single word like
servamus, servatis, servate. (On the line-beginning pate'r uocdt me Amph.
991 see Intr. iii. ξ 8.) An example of the emphatic pronoun is Men. 1076:

δύ. erus es3 tu seruom quaere3 ἠύ saluet03 tu uale.

Tibi 090 dico, ‘d'ye hear ?,’ has nor-mally the ictus tibi eqo dieo (a list of
examples will be found in Kaempf‚ Pronom. Personal. p. 17).

16. The corresponding double series of Possessive Pronouns in Romance,
eg. Ital. ‘mio' and ‘mo' (as in ‘ma-donna ²)1‚ point to an emphatic and
an unemphatic variety of the Labin Possessive, which seem to be reflecbed
in the versification of the Comedians. If we contrast, for example,
Cape. 261:

1¹1ss uos hic, *itidem ssli apud uos me'us seruatur fssius,

and its emphatic meus, with the subordinabed Possessive in a line like

Bacch. 251:
heu 06r meum ef, cerebrum, N icobule‚ finditur,

we shall nob be inclined to agree with those who find in the φατόν of Ter.
Ad. 983 an instance of conffict between accent and ictus:

faciet, o uir 6pbume‚ o φαιόν-νηί fesssim‘ssume2.

The malediction uae capiti tuo always shews this incidence of ictus in
Plautus, uae' capiti-tuo (for details see Niemoeller, Ipse et Idem, p. 37).

17. The emphatic Demonstrative is seen in phrases like is ‘³90 sum,
eqo is sum, which 'm Plautus always take the ictus on is, as contrasted with
the ordinary unemphatic usage, eg. propter-eoa praeter-eos. It is seen too
in a line like Poen. 394 :

oculus Maius, lippitudo mea, mel baius, fel meum.

18. sse common phrase ἓξ re} operam dabam (dabo, &c.) takes in the
lines of Plautus the ictus on the Pronoun and on the last syllable of operam,
ei r(ei) operam dabam (Seyffert, Scud. Flam p. 25 w). This conforms with
the subordination of the noun res (ξ 19) and of the verb do. J ust as we
throw the stress on the noun ‘noise' and not on ‘ohe verb ‘make' in the

’ ¹ Ital. mo, ma, Fr. mon, ηια, span. mi, ma point to a reduced Latin form
mus, ma, mum. Whether this form may be posited for Plautus and Terence is
doubtful. On Ennius' use of sas for snas etc., see Lat. Lanyuaye vii. 12.

² Mi pater and (less usual) pater-mi Voc.⁷ meus pater and (less usual) pater
meus Nom., seem to have been word-groups. Their accentuation would be
nti-pater, pater-mi, meas-pater (ξ 1, Intr. ii. ξ 3), pater-meus. And this is the
normal incidence of ictus iu these phrases in Plautus.
