58 INTRODUCTION.

from the choric strophes and antistrophes 01 Aristophanes is not
wholly satisfactory. Besides, certain features 01 Plautus' Cantica are
unlike anything in Aristophanes, 101 instance, the combination 01
certain metres in the same canticum, and especially the stichic use 01
some metres which are employed only as an occasional variety by the
Greek Comedian (g 1). Monodies make their appearance in the closing
period 01 the Old Drama, a famous instance being the song 01 the
Phrygian slave in the Orestes (vv. 1369-1502) with its novel
combination 01 all kinds 01 metres 3 and in this point, as in so
many others, Euripides appears as the founder 01 the later Dramatic
school. How far the Middle Comedy differed from the Old in this
„respect we do not know. At Alexandria the Monody was much
cultivated. The legitimate drama had been succeeded by what might
be called Music Hall songs (μαγῳδίαι, ἱλαρῳδίαι, etc), whose singers
wore the dress and acted the part 01 the personage depicted in the
verses.

The pretty little song recently discovered in Egypt¹ is apparently
one 01 these, for its stichic use 01 Dochmii cannot be satisfac-
torily paralleled from the Attic Drama. Twenty successive lines (vv.
24—43) are Dochmiac Monometers z Μέλλω μαίνεσθαι, ΙΙ Ζῆλος γάρ μ’
ἔχει, etc.

Prof. Leo² has accordingly proposed the very plausible theory
that Plautus found his models for his Cantica in the contemporary
Hellenistic μαγῳδίαι or ἱλαρῳδίαι, which were much in vogue at
Tarentum and other parts 01 Magna Graecia, and doubtless in
Rome itself. It is to these that he would look for the immediate
models for Plautus' stichic use of the Bacchiae metre (ξ 26), the
Versus Reiziani (ἓ 49), and for all the new types which occur in
the Roman dramatists.

A ccinparison by Aulus Gellius (11. xxiii.) of a passage 01 Caecilius with the
original passage of Menander, gives us an interesting example of the way in
which a Roman Coniedian‚ sor the sake of variety, substituted a lyric-passage or
song for the dialogue-passage of his original, Menander's lines are Iambic
Trimcters:
