in v. 2 of the Argument to the Casina: Conseruam umorem conserui duo
expetunt ,· Aliam senex asdletqat, aliam filius. It occurs also in some of the
Terence Arguments (Andr. 12 Hane Pamphilo, aliam dat Charino ccm-
iuqem ; Haut. 12 Hanc Clinia, aliam Clitipho ‘atrorem accipit). This use
of alius is found in post—classica] writers, eg. Tac. Hist. iv, 73, Sueton.

3. Capteiuos. This is the form postulated by the Acrostic. Yet
all our MSS. have captiuos. It seems that in some early archetype the
ei-diphthongs throughout the text were deliberately ‘ modernized' to ῖ, for
on the one hand the traces that remain of the older spelling are much
fewer than we should expect, and on the other we find now and then an ei
Wrongly changed to i, eg. uti for nt ei in V. 940 (cf. ad v. 908).

4. Some word or other has dropped out in the archetype of our MSS.
If it was captum, the loss would be caused by the similar ending
(Homoeoteleuton) of the neighbouring word (natum), the commonest
cause of the omission of a word in MSS. (cf. v. 74). Another plausible
emendation is recuperet <suom>‚ for small, unimportant words were often
omitted by scribes. Studens ut. In Plautus studeo takes the lnf. (eg.
audire Pseud. 523, me recipere illam Amph. 892, nuptias mutarier Stich. 52),
or the Dative (of Noun or Gerundive, eg. lectis sternendis Stich. 678, lais
factis Most. 29), very rarely the Acc. (eg. Iaces res Mil. 1437), but never ut
with Subj. (cf. Ter. Hauc. 382). Recuperet. The word recupero, though
employed in this sense in good Latin, does not occur at all in Plautus or
indeed in any of the Early Dramatists. Plautus uses recipio in this sense
(v. 103 πί illum recipit). It is conceivable that the writer of the Argument
who, as we have seen, freely avails himself of the diction of the play
(eg. quadrimum, commereatur, amittatur, indicio), meant recuperet for the
Imperf. Subj. of recipio (in archaie spelling recupio). The non-sequence of
the Tenses need not offer any difficulty (cf. v. 7).

5. Inibi was a word that would be known in the Imperial Age to
students of archaic Latinity. It is treated, for example, by Nonius
(p. 124 M.). There is therefore no need for Gulielmius' conjecture in ibus.
We may admit that this form of the Dat. Abl. Plur. of z's is used by
