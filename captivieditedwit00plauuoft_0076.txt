52 INTRODUCTION.

remarks of the first and second speakers in lines with hiatus or with syllaba
anceps, at the close of the first speaker‘s utteranee3 whereas, with elision,
the second speaker may be supposed to begin at the moment that the first has
finished. Varro appears to have recommensled the use of the sign Ι (a vertical
stroke) to indicate syllaba anceps (and hiatus?) due to a pause (Serm. Lat. iv.
frag. 74, Wilm.): quare in huiuscemodi locis poni oportet notam Ι transversam
inter syllabas, frequentius ad extremum versum senarium et similes, si pro
longa brevem habebunt extremam, ut in hoc:

amicus summus meus et popularis (cleta.

It is possible that traces of this symbol survive in our MSS. of Plautus (see
Schoell's Introd. to maculemus, p. xxxixa).

433 Even where there is no change of speaker there may be as
marked an interval between two utterances of the same speaker.
This will make our fifth form of Hiatus,

(5) when the same speaker resumes after an interval. For
example, in Poen. 685 Lycus addresses the first part of the line to
the audience‚ then going up to Collabiscus he addresses the second
part to him :

Blande hominem compellabo. Ι hospes hospitem
Salutat, dcc. (AF),

where the interval would in an English play be indicated by stage-
directions, thus :

LYC. (aside) Blande alze. (to Collabiscus) hospes dle.
Cf. Stich, 270:

Sed eccum Pinacium, eius puerum. Ι h6c uide (AF).

Similarly in Most. 484 Tranio first requests the attention of
Theopropides, then after a pause begins his story:

Ego dicam: ausculta. 1 iit foris cenauerat
Tuos gnatUS, &a (P, A u. L).

44. There is a danger of being over-fanciful in these matters,
and of attributing modern stage-conventions of enunciation to the
ancient (lelivery of quantitative verse with 01· without musical
acconlpaniment. Stil] there may be wari-ant for adding other
cases, more open to question, in which hiatus may have been
tolerated by Plautus :—

(o) Any marked pause in the line, where utterance would observe
the intervals of action 01· gesture, such as
