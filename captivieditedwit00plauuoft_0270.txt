509. The Mss. offer Eo...inde abii mei ubi. Various remedies of the
line are possible. One is, to suppose the scribe of some archetype to have
written aba· (suggested by abii v. 505, abiit V. 507) for ubi, and to have
corrected his mistake in the careless fashion of mediaeval copyists. The
true form of the line will then be:

Eo prbtz'nus ad fratrem inde uba· mei szznt alii captiui,

an Iambic Septenarius. But the scansion prbtz'nus ᾶοί is abnormal 111 an
Iambic line (Introd. iii. ξ 9). Leo follows Pylades in omitting inde abii and
prints an Iambic Septenarius: Eo firminus ad fratrem ‘mea' ubi saint aliz·
captiui, which, if we admit elision of mei (Introd. ii. ξ 15), might be also
scanned as an Anapaestic Dimeter with Golon Reizianum. Leo adds the
explanation that Hegio's brother's house stood on the way from the
praetor’s quarters to Hegio’s house, so that proteum-tor domum (v. 508) will
mean, ‘I take the road for homess and protinus will signify, ‘without
departing from this road' But to delete inde aba· is too violent treatment
of the traditional reading. A slighter change would be to read unde
for inde: Eo pratzssnus ad fratrem, vinde abii, mei ubi sunt aliz· captiui
(an Anapaestic Octonarius). This however requires us to suppose that
Hegio paid a visit to his brother's house before going to the praetor, an
unlikely supposition (cf. vv, 458—460). Probably it is the first word only
of the line (an Anapaestic Octonarius) which is corrupt. Some prefer
to delete aba· as an insertion by a scribe who failed to notice that the
punctuation came after and not before inde.

511, Most editors change omnium to hominumn. And yet the phrase
ecquis omnium (cf. Men. 812 cuius rei rerum onmium) is a permissible
phrase, not wholly unsuitable here, and we have no right to take
libcrties with the Mss. without cause. With ommim norit (on the
spelling in the Mss. nouerit see note on v. 83 cf. Introd. ii. ξ 32) the
last part of the line will be a ‘colon Reiziamnn.' With hominum nouerit
we have two Trochaic Dimeters eatalectic.
