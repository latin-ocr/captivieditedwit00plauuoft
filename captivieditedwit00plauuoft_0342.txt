Hic apud me, Ergasile. ERG. Mean me causa hoc
censes dicere?

851. Horraeum V: Horreum Ε] ut vid. trigonum libri 852. quem V

futurum, like Gk. ὁπόθεν, eg. Philetaerus Com. fr. 7 Κ. ἐὰν ἔχῃ τις ὁπόθεν.
Probably the word in this use was less of an enclitic than the ordinary
Relative Adverb. This would account for the scansion in illcn. 53 Sed ita
ἠΰ det ande czirari ἰοί possit sibi, Truc. 146 Ubi m‘m est scripturam ande debat,
z'ozczisaozt publicanos. (See Introd. ii. ξ 14.) Pernulam is substituted
by Geppcrt for pernam of the MSS. (On the confusion of Derivative and
Simple Nouns in our MSS. see note on v. 665.) Other suggestions are
pernam < quc>‚ and pernam <alium> If we retain pernam here, we
must suppose Ergasilus to pause a moment for reflection (Introd. ii. ξ 44).
Leo thinks the name of some fish (eg. peream) is required. And yet the
mention of ham at the beginning of a list of fish is surely no more peculiar
than the mention of cheese (v, 851) at the end of it. opthalmiam.

should be retained (opta). The double aspirate in loan-words from the
Greek was in Latin replaced by the mute with the aspirate; e.g. dz'ptltongyus,
autoetlaones‚ Erectheus are the normal Latin spellings. (For statistics see
Schulze‚ Ortltoyr. 1894.)

ii. ξ 6). Trygonum. Gk. τρυγών took in the Latin of Plautus’ day
the form truyonus (cf. Latona for Gk. Λητώ or Λατώ), as Gk. κῆτος, -εος,
a term used of any of the larger fish, took the form cetus, -ί (Aac. 375).
A derivative of the latter word, cetarius, ‘a fishmonger⁷ <ymas piscatorum
quod maiores pisces capit, Nonius, p. 49 M. )‚ occurs in Ter. Eun. 257 cupe-

852. Nominandi istorum...copia. “So Ter. Heaut. 29 nouarum

principium ycnerandi animalium, and about ten cases in other authors,
chiefly in Cicero. The governing word is one which takes an obJective
genitive (facultas, cupida-5, cupiens, causa, &c.), the gcrund is always from
a transitive vcrb.'' Mox-ris. See note 011 v. 1008.

853. Hic apud me. We should perhaps replace mc by the older form
med, a form constantly modernized in our MSS. of Plautus. This puts the
