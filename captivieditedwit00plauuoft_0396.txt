366 PLAVTI CAPTIVI.

relegated to the theses? Ritschl pointed out long ago in his Proleyomena
(ch. xvi.) how consistently this was done in lines like Prin. init. :

A. Sequere hac me, gnata, uc munus fungaris tuom.
B. Sequor3 sed finem fore quem dicam nescio,

or Trin. 20 sq.:
rogat
ut h'ceat possidere hanc nomen fabulam.

Here the imimportant words of the sentence (I have indicated them by
italics), the words which might almost be omitted without injury to the
sense, slip naturally into the theses of the lines. And since Ritschl's time
investigation of the incidence of metrica] ictus in Plautus and Terence has
revealed the significant fact that this, that and the other colloquial phrase,
phrases which evidently come direct from the streets of Rome into the
Comedians’ verse, observe as consistently a uniform incidence of ictus as a
uniform order of words ; and that, too, though there is often no necessity for
this from the prosodical nature of the syllables comprised. The common
phrase ‘ I wish to know,' volo scire, would from its prosodical nature, its
arrangement of short and long syllables, require a metrical accentuation
of this kind, vol& scire3 and we should expect to find Iambic lines beginning
υοῑὸ scire iyitur or vola scire az‘ctem, &c. But the metrical accentuation in
all the dialogue passages where the phrase occurs in Plautus is νοῐό scire
(except in two where it is υύῖο scire, Kellerhoff in Studemund's Studien
ii. 83), an accentuation which agrees with the normal subordination of the
Auxiliary Verb volo (ξ 2). Similarly the phrase of endearment, voluptas
mea, is always scanned by Plautus voleptds mea, with a shortening of the
second syllable which is found when the next syllable has the natural accent,
e.g. voZzZptdtz's, voZzZptdtem, potestatem <Intr. ii. ξ 20); and this scansion
corresponds to that shifting of the accent of volviptas which we should
expect to be produced by the enclitic appendage mea (ξ 2). A common
expression of disappointment or despair is vae'mz'serb mz'lzz‘, with this order
of words and with metrical ictus on the Interjection and the last syllable
of misero, not the first. Here too the enclitic appendage milzz‘ would shift
the accent from the first syllable of misero (the syllable on which the word
would be accented if it stood alone) to the last. Those who cling to the
theory that the Dramatists paid no regard in the construction of their
verse to the natural accentuation of words, have strangely cited these
phrases as examples of an incidence of ictus that conflicts with the
elementary law of Latin Accentuation, the ‘Paenultima Law' ; for this
would require as the ordinary accent volo scire, volviptas mea, vae? misero
mihi. This elementary law of word-accentuation, the accentuation of
independent words, is the only law to which these theorists appeal. The
fact that certain words, in certain collocations in a sentence, would have a
different accent from that which thoy would bear if pronounced separately‚
has hardly ever been considered in their discussion of the relation of ictus
