165. “The world knows nothing of its greatest men,'’ Philip van
Artevelele.

167. Habe modo bonum animum (see note on v. 152).

168. In his diebus. Cf. Pseud. 316 eqo in hoe triduo Aut terra aut
mari aliquo‘nole euoluam iel argentum tibi. The phrase more often laeks in,
e.g. Most. 238 Nam neque edes quicquam neque bibes apud me his decem
diebus, Pers. 504 Neque istoc redire lzz’s octo possum memibus3 ef. Poen. 872,
Ter. Adel. 520. Reconciliassere. See note on v. 33. These forms
with -ss- belong mostly to the First Conjugation, though we find in the
Second prohibessz't, cohibessit (Luer. iii. 444), Ζίοεεείί (Plaut. Asin. 603), δια,
while for the Fourth ambissit (MSS. ambisset> in the (un-Plautine 2) pro-
logue of the Amphitruo (v. 71) is quoted. By Terenee’s time they are
going out of use. Appellassz‘s (Phorm. 742) is one of the few instances
found in his plays. By origin these are s-Aorist forms, like faxo &e
(see note on v. 695), and corresponcl exaetly to the Greek S-Aorists of
Vowel Conjugations. Thus reconciliasso, Subjunotive with Future force,
corresponds to Greek τιμήσω Subj„ originally τιμῖῖσσω, as elixo (oleixo)
corresponds to Greek δείξω Subj. The parts which are found in Latin are
(1) ‘ Fut.' Subj. reconciliasso, -z‘s &e., (2) Opt. reconciliassim, -is δια, (3) Inf.
recomliassere (ef. confido me impetrassere Aul. 687, Mil. 1128, expuynassere
Amph. 210), (4) in legal diction also a passive, eg. mereassitur (O. I. L. i.
200. 71), turba-&sitm in a law in Cicero (cle Lefyy. iii. 4. 11).

169. With Hiatus after nam and Hiatus after eccum, both of them pro-
bably legitimate cases of Hiatus (Introd. ii. §§ 41, 44), the line will need no
alteration. The supposed defect in the line is usually supplied by editors
With <inlu-3> Aleum (cf. Bacch. 568 (luas erqo lzz'e intus eccas Bacchides).
But I see no reason for not believing the Captivos to be on the stage
throughout this Scene (see note on v. 252). If a word is missing, it may
be alium, which would easily be omitted by a scribe before Aleum (mis-
written alium) :
