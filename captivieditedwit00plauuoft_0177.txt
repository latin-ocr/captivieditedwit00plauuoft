107—109] Ac'r. 1. sc. 1. 149

Condigne pater est eius moratus moribus.
Nune ad eum pergam. Sed aperitur ostium,
Unde saturitate saepe ego exii ebrius.

107. condigne has usually (like commereo) a bad sense in Plautus,
eg. Men. 906 condique autem haec meretrix fecit, ut mos est meretricius (cf.
Mil. 505 Iba· dum eondiffltam te sectatu's simiam), but not always, eg. con—
dique Bacch. 392, eondiynas Amph. 537-8. Moratus moribus, a
favourite phrase: Asin 506 istoc more moratam, Ter. Hec. 644 sed quid
mulieris uxorem habes aut quibus moratam moribus ?‚ Titin. Com. 59 R. si
sitis moratae ambae ibus pro ut eqo moribus.

108. The opening monologue of Peniculus, Ergasilus' counterpart in
the Menaechmi, is sirnilarly broken off with the line (ν. 108); Nunc ad
eum inuiso. Sed aperitur ostium.

109. On the scansion und’ saturitate see Introd. ii. ξ 14. Saturitas is
Ergasilus' patron divinity (vv. 877-8) :

ita me amabit sancta Saturitas,
Heyio, itaque sao me semper condecoret coynomz'ne,
Ut eqo uicti.

saturitate ebrius. The word satur (saturitas) is used with reference
to drink in Cure. 362, and elsewhere, eg. Mart. iii. 58. 44, Petron. fr. xxix,
S. Augustin. Confess. vi. 6. 9 (cf. v. 771 below). But perhaps it is ebrias
in this line, and not saturitate, that should not be taken literally. Hallidie
compares the humorous misuse of iaqnto in Stich. 581 ut me hodie iaqu-
larem fame. Exii should not be changed to Enim (Stich. 459 Auspicio
hodie <optztme> optmno emieat foras). For emti, cf. Pseud. 1282, a bacchiac
line: Inde hzic exii, crapulam clam amouerem (exim A. eci P) (cf. ad
V. 194).

Aet I. Scene ii. Hegio, dressed in white (the colour worn by old men
in Comedy), comes out of his house accompanied by the overseer of the
slaves, who is carrying two light sets of setters. Going up to the two
Captives, he gives orders that they be put in the new fetters with liberty
to walk about. As he turns to go away (V. 126), Ergasilus attracts his
attention, and the two hold a conversation, in the course of which (V. 167)
Hegio announces his plan 01· exchanging Tyndarus (1.0. the pretended
Philocrates) for Philopolemus. After giving Ergasilus an invitation to
dinner, Hegio goes back into the house.

The humorous as well as the kindl)v side of Hegids charaeter is admir-
ably brought out in this Scene. He clearly is ‘condigne moratus moribns'
