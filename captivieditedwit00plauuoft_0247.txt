est Bacchidis), or (the usual construction) to a Possessive Pronoun, e.g. in
rem meam, tuam, ἅτε. (cf. V. 386). The Pronoun uterque appears in this
connexion as utrique (A ul. 129 quod in rem esse utrique arbitremur, Ter. Andr.
546 Si in remst utrique ut fiant), which suggests that —z' is an old ending of
the Genitive case of the Pronoun, an ending of which we have various
traces, more or less certain, in the early literature (see note on V. 471).
The phrases e re, ab re take the same construction as in rem, the Gen. of a
Noun being found in Asin. 224 haud est ab red aucupis. The Pronoun iste
appears as istius in the MSS. of Ter. lerm. 969 Non lze'rcle ex re istius me
instiqastz', Demipho, but the metre requires a disyllable (see Introd. ii. ξ 15).
There is stronger evidence however for a Gen. ending -z' in Pronouns like
uterque, alius, &e than in Demonstrative Pronouns. It is conceivable that
the words At quam...ma.z·z'me are spoken by Tyndarus, in which case
utrique would convey a different significance to Philocrates than to Hegio.
That Philocrates should address his next remark to Hegio would be natural
enough. The distribution of the speakers in this Scene in our MSS. does
not always seem to rest on ancient authority.

400. Patri. We have also ad patrem &e (so vv. 360, 384> with
nuntiare, eg. Bacch. 391 ut servos meus mi nuntiauit Chry-salua Truc. 702
Ita ad me mayna nuntiauit Cyamus hodie grandia.

401. The line is pcrfectly right as it stands. Tyndarus is casting
about in his mind for some equivocal form of message and repeats the

me hic ualere of v. 391 to gain time. Audacter dicito. Most. 916,
Pseud. 828 ; cf. Epid. 16, Mero. 726, Maem. prol. 52.

402. Fuisse. The omission of the Subjcct (here nos) is common
enough in Plautus (cf. v. 420, and see noto on V. 365). But it is soniewhat
awkward here, where there is already a Subjent, me.
