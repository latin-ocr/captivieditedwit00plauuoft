116 PLAVTI CAPTIVI.

Domum sermones fabulandi conferant,

Ne et hic uiris sint et domi molestiae.

...... Dum ludi fiunt, in popinam, pedisequi,
Inruptionem facite3 nuno, dum occasio est,

Nunc, dum scriblitae <aestu> aestuant, occurrite.
Haec imperata quae sunt pro imperio histrico,
Bonum hercle factum pro se quisque ut meminerit.

And the fate of a dramatist, who failed to get hold of his audienoe at
the outset of the play, is known to us from the second prologue to the

Hecyra, VV. 25 sqq. z
Cum primum eam agere coepi, pugilum gloria,
Funambuli eodem accessit (accersiti Leo) expectatio:
Comitum commistim, strepitus, clamor mulierum

Fecere ut ante tempus exirem foras.
...refero denuo.

Primo actu placeo, cum interea rumor uenit
Datum iri gladiatores: populus conuolat,
Tumustuantur, clamant, pugnant de loco:
Ego interea meum non potui tutari locum.

We must bear this in mind in reading the prologue to the Captivi.
The first care of the speaker of the prologue is to secure a peaceful and
intelligent hearing of the complicated plot. He begins with a joke designed
to put into good humour those usual disturbers of the peace, the late-
comers who cannot find a seat (see note on v. 2, and cf. Apul. Flor. 111.
xvi. 65 extimas quisque emunecctz' queruntur), and, after a little, tries
sterner methods with them (vv. 11--14). The plot is explained slowly,
minutely, with many repetition& and the most complicated part of it,
the exchange of name and dress by the Captives, is driven into the minds
of the audience by frequent indication of the two personages, who had for
this very purpose been stationed on the stage before the commencement of

the action of the play; eg. VV. 38—9:

Illic uocatur Philocrates, hic Tyndarus:
Huius illic, hic illius hodie fert imaginem.

Another appcal for an attentive hearing follows (vxi. 53 sqq.); then the
andience is coaxcd into good humour by some pleasantry; and the speaker
of the prologue leaves the stage.
