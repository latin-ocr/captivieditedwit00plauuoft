111. METRE. 99

and in 169 uuuuu (anaclastic) opus quietus. We have another

certain Ionio passage in the penultimate Scene of the Pseudolus,
e.g. v. 127 5:

probe Ionica l perdidici Ι sed palliollatim amictus,

though the text of the neighbouring lines is unfortunately not free
from uncertainty.

In the Greek Drama the Bacchiae is associated with the Ionio

rhythm. Thus the hymn of the Mystae in the Froys of Aristophanes
begins (v. 324) :

Ἴακχ’ ὦ Ι πολυτιμήιτοις ἕδραις ἐνΙθάδε ναίων,

with the first foot a Bacchius (044). Similarly in Plautus the
Sotadic passage just quoted from the Amphitruo is followed by
Bacchiae Tetrameters, and the Pseudolus passage has Bacchiacs in
close proximity. ⁸

K. 001011 Reizianum, Versus Reizianus.

49. The Oolon Reizianum, of which there are several types,
(1)ῦ-υ->έ, (2) ῦ-υ υ-ῦ, (3) 0 ψ-ψ-ῦ, δια, appears in Aristo
phanes as the catalectic form of an acephalous Glyconic. Thus in
the Kniyhts, VV. ll4l-4, we have three ‘acephalous⁷ Glyconics

(i.e. Glyconics wanting the first syllable) followed by the Oolon
Reizianum:

σκέψασθε δέ μ’ εἰ σοφῶς
αὐτοὺς περιέρχομαι
τοὺς οἰομένους φρονεῖν
καί μ’ ἐξαπατύλλειν,
and similarly Eccl. 291-3 :
ἄλλ’, ὦ Χαριτιμίδη
καὶ Σμίκυθε καὶ Δράκης

ἕπου κατεπείγων.

It follows an Iambic Dimeter in such passages as Aeli. 840 :
ἢ συκοφάντης ἄλλος, οῖῑῐμώζων καθεδεῖται,
and Pam 954 :

φυσῶντι καὶ πονουμένῳ Η προσδώσετε δή που.

This composite line (Iambic Dimeter with Colon Reizianum), called
the Versus Reizianus, is not infrequent in Plautus. In eontrast to
