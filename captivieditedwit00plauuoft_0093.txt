111. METRE. 69

of this resolved arsis between worda i.e. the addition ot the pause at the ena of
a word to the time occupied by the two short syllables, must have been felt,
when the thesis was a long instead of a short syllable, to increase somewhat
unduly the length of the dactyl or anapaest, and make them rather more than a
fair equivalent of an iambus (or trochee). It is only in the first foot of the line
(or hemistich) that such a dactyl (or in Trochaic verse an anapaest> is freely
admitted by Plautus and Terence, e.g. z

Haut. 237 pergin Istuc prius diiudicare, &a

For full details of the presence and permissibleness of these divisions in the
Iambic and Trochaic lines of the Early Dramatists, see Maurenbrecher, H [atus
und Verschlezfunq pp. 25 sqq. Mero. ’ΠΒ-4 will serve as example of the
unfavoured (v. 773) and the permissible (v. 774) divisions:

cur hic astamus? quin abimus? Incdmmodi
si quid t1b(i) Euenit, id non est culpa mea (ΑΡ).

The list given by Klotz on pp. 257 sqq. of his GrundzHye is to a great extent
based on the wholly unwarranted assumption that the Law of Breves Breviantes
(ii. ξ 16) is controlled by the metrica] ictus of the verse, and not by the actual
pronunciation of every-day life. Klotz accordingly will not recognize the pyrrich
scansion of any iambus-word whose two syllables do not belong to the same
arsis or thesis, and so scam, for example, apde instead of ‹11›de (the invariable

scansion before a noun, ii. § 19) in Pseud. 645 (trochaic), which ends re‘s αῃίττῗν
ἅρῑῖἀ iadicem sci& instead of sci5 in Hec. 398 (trochaic) :

dicam abortum esse: scio nemini aliter suspectum fore,

where the strong pause between esse and scio would make the division v, ν- very
harsh indeed; ubi instead of ubi in Aul. 204 (trochaic) :

credo edepdl, ubi mentionem ego fecero de filia,

though why ubi in the phrase ubi mentionem eqo fecero should be refused the
possibility of the pronunciation ubi is hard to see (cf. Phorm. 827 se'd ubi nam,
an Iambic hemistich-ending). This theory that Plautus admits the ictus quos
ubi or quos ribi (Dactyl), ubi quo‘s or abi quos (Anapaest), zzbi quis (Tribrach),
but not quis ubi (Tribrach), is usually defended by an appeal to Anapaestic Verse,
in which we have numerous examples like Poen. 1185 at pol 395 quo‘m (cf. Rud.
188 hancine 2³96 partem), but very few like Poen. 1180 cannis ibsz clientarum,
and these, from the nature of the case, nearly always capable of another
scansion, eg. ibi clientarum (Seyffert in Bursian's Jahresbericht 1895, p. 260).
But the character of Anapaestic Verse, with its predilection for Diaeresis (ξ 21),
is unfavourable to such a collocation of syllables as 5, vv, νέω, and the
preference of a scansion like po‘l eqo to po‘l effl in an anapaestic line is really
due to the exigencies of the anapaestic mette. The scansion and pronunciation
ερῦ was the rule, ⁶95 the exception, as early as Plautus, in whose dialogue-
metres we have Trochaic line-endings like e‘t effl vos, Mil. 1138 (cf. pol eqo nanc,
Rud. 238, Cretic), even under the stringent conditions which regulate this part
of the line¹. Unluckily for Klotz's theory the appeal to Anapaestic verse proves
too much. It involves the rejection of po'l 0915 as well as of po‘l ubi.

1 Seyffert (Berl. Philol. Wochensehr. xviii. 1577) shows that potin(e)‚ Μάρκῳ),
abin(e)‚ dcc. are not allowed to represent an Iambus at the end of a line or

hemistich in Plautus.
