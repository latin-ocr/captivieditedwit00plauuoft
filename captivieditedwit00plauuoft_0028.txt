6 INTBODUCTION.

10. Two other MSS. come from an original (Pss), which was
itself a copy of PBD, so that their evidence is of little or no value
against the united testimony of B and D. They are :—

(E) in the Ambrosian Library, Milan (J 257 insi), saec. xii. ult.

Part of the Aulularia (vv, 192—605) has been added by a l5th cent.
corrector1 from the ‘Itala recensio.'

(V) in the University Library, Leyden (Voss. lat. 4⁰. 30), saec.
xii. in. It has lost Amph„ Asin„ Aul. 1-189, Epid. 245—fin.

11. Oertain corrections (V2) in the Leyden MS. come from an
inferior ‘doctored’ text of PE (see Class. Rev. x. 319) which was
the original of the two MSS. that remain to be mentioned 2-—

(J) in the British Museum (Ray. 15 C. XL), saec. xii. in.‚ a MS.
somewhat damaged by fire.

It contains a ‘subscriptio,’ which seems to have been copied from the
original ⁴ doctored' text:

Exemplar mendum tandem me compulit ipsum
Cunctantem nimium Plautum exemplarier istum,

Ne graspicus (leq. graphicus) mendis proprias idiota repertis
Adderet et liber hic falso patre falsior esset.

(O) in the Ottobonian collection at the Vatican (Ottob. Misc. lat.
657), saec. xi., a mere fragment containing Capt. 400—555.

This ‘doctored' text of the first eight plays is practically useless.
The ‘Itala recensio,' based in the last twelve plays upon D, seems
in the earlier plays to have been based on a MS. that exhibited this
‘doctored' text. All Renaissance MSS. of Plautus are therefore
of no value whatsoever as evidence for the text of Plautus, whether
in the first eight or in the last twelve plays. Where they diverge
from the P›text their reading is due either to a corruption in their
original or to conjectura] emendation by their editor. A collation
of one MS. of this kind (F, a Leipzig MS.) will be found in the.
Critical Apparatus of the large Teubner edition of Plautus, a
collation of parts of another, the Codex Burneianus at the British

Muscum (Bura. 228) in the Appendix to my Cocleae Turnebi qs
Plautus.

12. All these extant minuscule MSS. and ¹1¹, a lost minuscule h
MS„ we have found to be descendants of a common archetype ΡΑ,

¹ The corrections by this hand are ignored in my critical notes, as are the i
corrections by Renuissancc hands in the other MSS.
