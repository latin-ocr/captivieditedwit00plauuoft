] 14 PLAVTI CAPTIVI.

providentia etiam subsellia, quibus ad lteram conqestis in ludorum spectaculo
iam uti civitas coeperat, prohiberet apponi. We have no good reason for
doubting that seats were provided for the spectators as early as Plautus'
time. In 194 B.c. the front places were reserved for senators. (For a
full discussion of the question, see Fabia in Revue de Philoloyie, xxi.
pp. 11 sqq. 3 Marquardt and Mommsen, Rom. Attertlcz'tmer3 vL p. 482.)

Various indications however of a post-Plautine authorship are pointed
out in the notes to vv. 10, 19 (if we retain the reading of the MSS.), 34, 40,
49, 50, 54, 55. Their united evidence is strong enough to make a ‘prima
facie’ case against the genuineness of the whole or the greater part of our
prologue, especially since it does not contain any clear traces of Plautus’
genius. It has the appearance here and there of having been made out of
lines of the ‘internal prologue' of the piece, the opening monologue of
Ergasilus (see notes on vv. 4, 24, 27—8), with the subsequent remarks
of Hegio (see note on v. 34).

The ancient commentators on Terence commend that poet for his skill
in explaining to the audience the plot of a play in its opening scene. The
first scene of the Andria is praised for its thoroughly satisfactory explana-
tion of the plot without the clunisy aid of a narrative prologue or a ‘deus
ex niachina' (Donat. in Andr. Ι. i. 1 llaec scaena pro arymaenti narratione
proponitur, in qua fundamenta fabulae iaciuntur, ut virtute poetae sine
officio proloyi vel θεῶν ἀπὸ μηχανῆς et periocham comoediae populus teneat et
res a9i mayis quam narrari videatur). This method is expressly alluded to
by Terence himself in the prologue to the Adelphoe, vv, 22--42

Dehinc ne expectetis cwyumentu‘m fabulae,
»S'cncs qai primi uenient, i partem aperient,
In ayendo partem ostendent.

But it was not peculiar to Terence. Plautus follows it in more than one
of his plays. Indeed the lines of Terence just quoted are a reminiscence
of the prologue to the Trinummus, vv. 16—17:

Sed de aryumento ne exspectetis fabulae,
Senes qui huc uenient, i rem uobis aperient.

In the Captivi the information required for the comprehension of the
piece is given in the opening soenes of the play by Ergasilus (vv, 92—101)‚
Hegio (vv. 110—1) and the two Captives (vv. 219 sqq), and it seems at first
sight as if the narrative in the prologue was superfluous. But there is one
piece of information necessary, if not for the comprehension, at least for
the appreciation of the play, which could not be imparted to the audience
during the action of the play itself, and that is the relationship of one of the
Captives to Hegio. It was absolutely necessary that the audience should
know from the outset that Tyndarus was Hegio's long-lost son; for other-
wise all the delicate irony of the situation in the soenes between Hegio and
Tyndarus would be lost upon them, nor could they help being puzzled by
the noble traits of the seeining slave's character. In no way could this
