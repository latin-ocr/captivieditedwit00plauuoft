Thus neither Plautus nor Terence uses the stems sedes, rupes, tabes, caedes,
&c. ; and mobis Nom. Sing. appears in Illerc. 880. It is unfortunate that the
reading of the Ambrosiam Palimpsest in this line is not quite free from
doubt. In nostram...d.omum. So Trz'n. 382 (ΑΡ), and in nostra
domo Cas. 620 (AP), Pseud. 84 (AP); though 111 Tmo. 261, where A has
z'n ‘nostra domo, the Palatine reading is nostrae doma· (as in fllen. 359, Most.
874, Poen. 838). Abraham proposes to delete in.

912. Lupus esuriens was a current phrase, like our ‘ravening wo1f.'
Of. Stich. 605 Nam illie homo tuam hereditatem inhiat, quasi esuriens lupus,
577 A tque eccum tibi lupam m sermone: praesens, esuriens adest. Metui.
On the quantity metm? see Introd. ii. ξ 6. The reading however is
uncertain, for the Ambrosian Palinipsest seems to have timui. Niemeyer
very plausibly conibines metue? of P and timui of A into metui timui, the
same combination as in Mil. 1347 stletuoquc et timeo, ue hoc tandem pro·
palam *fiat aionis. Of. Pseud. 1019 Nimisque <390 illum> hominem metuo et
formido male. Timidus and pauidus are similarly united in Cure. 649
(cf. leuel. 663). Cf. Cic. I'err. IV. 41 metu ac temore. For the Asyndeton
cf. Most. 1031 perii interii. The suggestion esuriens me timui lacks a
parallel to the construction of esurio with an Accusative; and mi timui,
although a Terentian construction (eg. Haut. 531 aba· timui), is perhaps
not Plautine. Male timui (Aul. 208> is unlikely with male formidabam in
the next line. flletuo is commoner in Plautus than timeo, which (though
by no means rare) is found mostly in certain formulae, such as ne time
(a suitable ending of a line), totus timeo (alliterative), &c. (Timeo and
metuo are variants in Ter. Haut. 620.) Some change qmisi to quo'tsi or
quam 825 (cf. ad v. 1024) and make the line trochaic (with metzlz').

912³. This line, owing to the similar ending of v. 912 (Homoeoteleuton),
was omitted in some archetype of the Palatine MSS„ and its existence was
never suspected until the discovery of the Ambrosiam Palimpsest. To
what extent the same thing has happened in other parts of the play, for
which the evidence of the Palilnpsest is lacking, it is difficult to say.
From a computation of the leaves lost in A between vv. 931 and 1008
Studeniund conjectured that a good many more lines must have been
contained in this part in A than appear in the other MSS. This cannot
however bc regarded as a certainty. Since the metre in this part is
