122 PLAVTI CAPTIVI. [15, 16

Vos qui potestis ope uestra censerier‚ 15
Accipite relicuom: alieno uti nihil moror.

15. censenrier V2J 16. reliquom libri nichilE

15. ‘You whose means entitle you to be rated on the censor's 1ist,'
opibus censi and not capite censi. Ope. The Singular Number of
this word is associated with the meaning ‘help,’ eg. opem ferre alicui
(=opitulari alicui), the Plural with the sense ‘resourceS,⁷ ‘means,' ‘wealth‚'
eg. dives opum (cf. in—ops, in-opia, copia, i.e. ‘co-opia'); cf. Ennius
Tray. 89 R. ex opibus summis opis eyens, Hector, tuae. But the line
dividing the two meanings is not very sharply drawn in the diction of
Plautus (cf. Mil. 220 opem aut-iliumque with Rud. 349 orbas auxilique
opumque), whose use of the Plura] seems often to be (lue to the presence
of other Plurals in the sentence, eg. Cape. 517 spes opes aua-iliaque,
Amph. 1053 spes atque opes uitae meae, Merc. 111 summis opibus uiribusque,
Most. 348 summis opibus atque industriis, Trin. 467 uostras..faetiones atque
opes. There is therefore no ground of objection to the use of the Singular
here or Epid. 152 Aliqua ope exsoluam, eoetricabor aliqua. censerier.
On the termination see note on v. 13.

16. ⁶ Receivc the instalment (of the narrative) that is still due. I do
not care to be a debtor.' The idea of the speaker of the prologue being
in the debt of his audience recurs in the prologue to the Cistellaria
vv. 188—9:

Nunc quod relicuom restat uolo persoluere,
Ut expungatur nomen, ne quid debeam.

We have a similar idea in other Latin writers, eg. Auct. ad Herenn. ii.
31. 50 nos alacriores ad relicum persoluendum. Relicuom. This Adj.
is invariably quadrisyllabic (with the first syllable short) in the Republican
DrainatistS, and <with the first syllable long) in the Republican Epic Poets.
It appears as a trisyllable in Persius and subsequent poetS. Nihil
moror, ‘I do not care,' with Ins„ as hore, or with Aoo, as in Most. 746
nihil moror mi istiusmodi clientis, is a common expression in colloquial
Latin, meaning literally (since moror has always a transitive sense in early
Latin) ‘ 1 do not at all detain,' ‘ 1 have no inclination to detainf This was
tho formula with which the consul ended a sitting of the ¹senate, niltil uos
moramur, patres conscripti, and the judge gave a vordict of acquittal,
eg. C. Sempronium niliil moror Liv. iv. 42. 8 3 quum se m‘ln‘l morari
magistrum equitum pronuntiasset viii. 35. 8. Nihil is occasionally
a disyllable at the ond of the line (1.0. for metrical convenience) in Terence,
(l'liorm. 940, Haut. 896), but clear evidence that the disyllabic pronuncia-
tion was recognized by Plautus is wanting (sce Truc. 333, 696, and below,
v. 1035 cf. Introd. ii. ξ 15).
