11. PRosoDY. 33

These pronunciations differed from the literary forms much as our

every-day pronunciation ‘ of'n ⁷ differs from the more exact articula-
tion of the spelling ⁴ of-ten.’

19. Under what circumstances does Plautus admit the shortened
pronunciationsZ They are found (to omit examples like tibi) in :—

(l) Iambic words (a) with naturally long vowel in final syllable
——especially subsidiary Verbs of common use ending in a vowel, such
as cave (eg. caue-dicas), uolo (eg. uolo-scire), dabo (eg. dabo—playam),
dedi (eg. dedi-playam), and Nouns like homo (e.g. homa-doctus),
domi (eg. domi-restat), domo (eg. domo-prodit). Next in order of
frequency come some words in -r, -t (finals before which in sub-
sequent poetry long vowels are invariably shortened), eg. moror,
loquor, amat, neqat, soror, minor3 while words in -s are rarely
shortened (at least in the dialogue metres), e.g. viros, bonos, foras
(eg. fords-ire), fores (e.g. fores-paltat), and words ending in a diph-
thong hardly ever, eg. nouae-napta& bonae-fraqi.

Statistics of the shortening of naturally long final syllables of iambic words
in the dialogus metres (iambic and trochaic) of Plautus are given by Lepper-
mann: de correptione ¹uocabulorum iambicorwn quae apud Plautum in senariis
atque septenariis iambicis et trochaicis inuenitur. Miinster‚ 1890. It need
hardly be repeated now-a—days that the old explanation of canes...turbinaes Trin.
835 as relics of an early Lat. Nom. Pl. in -e‘s (cf. Gk. κύνες, ἄτα.) has long since
been abandoned. The fantastic theory of Ecthhpsis, c'nes, δια, scarcely
deserves mention. In Cretic and Bacchiae Cantica (ξ 34²²) the shortened forms
are the exception. For details of dedi in dedi-ddno, δια, see Abraham, stud.
Plaut. p. 211. In Terence the Adverb is normally modo (see Hauler ad
Phorm. 869).

(b) With naturally short vowel in final syllable. Lengthening
by ‘position' is dispensed with, especially in subsidiary words like
enim (normally a pyrrich before a consonant-initia] in Plautus and
Terence 3 see Leo, Plaut. Forschuuyew, p. 303), simul, tamen, qui-
dem, and the like. Apud, for example, before an unemphatic
Pronoun like me, te, nos, vos bore the aceent on the second syllable,
and is scanned as an iambus, aquid-me, &a 3 but was unaccented in
collocations like apucbmffsam, apud-templum, and is scanned as a
pyrrich (cf. apud forum, eg. Cure. 474 6229de forum piscarium 3 for
details see Leo, plaut. Forsclc. p. 226, Skutsch in Jahresber. Roman.
Philol. iv. 83. On apud-abs, with emphatic nos, see iii. g ll).

similarly in the Dactylic Verse of Ennius, non enim rumores ponebat ante
salutem (Arm. 287 M.)‚ (11)de Cumas (Sat. 56 Μ.).
