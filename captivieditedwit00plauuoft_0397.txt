and accent in Plautus' lines. And yet it surely stands to reason that Latin,
like other languages, would have its enclitic words, its auxiliary verbs, its
emphatic and unemphatic pronouns, its subordinate words in certain word-
grouPS‚ and that in a spoken sentence each and every word would not have
meted out to it the full measure of accent which would be assigned to it
when pronounced apart. In the phrase volo scire the verb volo is a mere
auxiliary, which resigns its accent in favour of the important word of the
phrase, scire. In voluptas mea the Possessive Pronoun is an enclitic
appendage of the Noun, and the compound word voluptas-mea is by the
ordinary law of Latin Accentuation accented on the antepenultimate,
voluptas-mea. The Personal Pronoun is treated in the same way as the
Possessive in vae' misem-mihi.

Other examples of colloquial phrases in which a particular incidence of ictus
is invariably or normally found are nil moror ‘I don’t care,' ez19(ae) eziyae!
‘bravo !,’ misertim me, or me miserum ‘alas !’ (Kellerhoff in Studemund’s Studien,
ii. 76), heti me miserum (Richter ibid. i. 565), mein& mane, ‘wait a bit' (instances
collected by Leo ad Cist. 704), 1ιὰὺέ ὸοτι(ἰιηι)ιῐηὶτηωη, ‘cheer upl' (instances in
Loch Imperat. p. 17), a‘t ita me in oaths, tibi eqo dico in requests for attention
(instances in Kaempf Pers. Pron. p. 17), quis hic est? (also quz's hic est 3), quid 1160
est .⁷‚ quid est quod....²‚ quid istuc est qu‹›d....² (instanees in Dittmar lat. Modus-
lehre, pp. 11 sqq.). And now that attention has been called to this point, a
great many more will inevitably be discovered as time goes on. It is now
coming to be recognized as the duty of an editor of Plautus to confirm the
insertion or retention of a current phrase in this or that line by an appeal, not
merely to the arrangement of the words, but also to the incidence of ictus, in the
other occurrenees of the phrase throughout the plays. The emendation num
quae est causa for num quae causa est of the MSS. in the line (Aul. 262):

A. Hodie quin faciamus num quae causa est ἶ) Β. 11111110 edepol optuma,

can be confidently rejected because it departs from the invariable order of the
words in all other occurrences of the phrase in Plautus. We may almost as
confidently reject any emendation which would involve a metrical ictus like
‘volo‘ scire, vae misero mihi, dcc„ in a dialogue passage.

12. The existence of a secondary accent along with the main accent
must be considered in a discussion of Sentence-Accentuation as well as
of Word-Accentuation. Just as a long word like tempestate could not be
pronounced without a perceptible minor accent on the first syllable as well
as the main accent on the paenultima, so a long word—group like jus-juran-
dum must have had a secondary accent on jus. The Latin Grammarians,
as we have seen, scarcely ever allude to this secondary accent, whether in
single words or in word-groups. They tell us, for example, that unde, the
Relative, was an enclitic or subordinate word in the Latin sentence, in
contrast to the accented Interrogative unde. But they do not add, what
the analogy of other languages would lead us to expect, that in collocations
like und(e)-adv6nimus, u7cd(e)-adve'nz' a secondary accent fell on the Relative.
They are as silent about this secondary accent that must surely have
accrued in such collocations to subordinate words, as they are about the

secondary accent in long words like tempestate and in word-groups like
