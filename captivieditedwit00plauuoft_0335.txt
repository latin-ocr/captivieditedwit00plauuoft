826—828] Ac'r. 1v. se. 11. 305

Tantus uentri conmeatus meo adest in portu cibus.
Sed ego cesso hunc Hegionem onerare laetitia senem,
» Qui homine <homo> adaeque nemo uiuit fortunatior.

826. versum laudat Prisc. inst. VI p. 158, 23 Η. (s. υ. cibus cas. ⁸qenetiv.) ‘tantus
...cibus' comneatusE ι comeatus Prisc. codd.DHLK: commeatus cett. porti J

VE ut vid. J adeque BE: adequae V: adaequae J nemo (ne ex m) V
furtunatior J

melior mulierum, a line which exhibits the same use of the Comparative
for the Superlative. On the meaning of rex see the note on v. 92.

826. conmeatus. Cf. Mil. 224 Qua cibatus commeatusque ad te et
leyiones tuas Tuto possit peruenire. Cibus. Priscian takes this for a
Fourth Decl. Gen. Sing.‚ instead of Nom. Sing. with uentri commeatus meo
in apposition. The same doubt attaches to lectus in Amph. 513:

Prius abis quam lectus ubi cubuisti concaluit locus,

where Priscian makes the word a Fourth Decl. Gen. Sing. governed by
locus, though it may equally be Nom. Sing. with ubi cubuisti locus in
apposition. In view of the narrow limits of the F ourth Declension in
Plautus (see note on v. 855), Ι hesitate to accept Priscian's explanation.
For the inverted order of the sentence cf. Mil. 1043 deus diynz'or fuit qais-
quam homo qut esset? Brix suggests punctuation after adest, the Verb to
be understood as repeated after cibus.

827. Hunc Hegionem...senem. For the order cf. ad V. 875, and for
the sense of hunc, ad v, 7. In Aul. 171 we have:

Nostin hunc senem Euclionem ex proxumo pauperculum'.2

There is no need to make this and similar phrases with cesso Interrogative
Sentences.

828. The defect in the line is likely to have been caused by the loss
(through Haplography) of the word homo in some form. Leo accepts
Camerarius’ insertion of hominum after lemniae. But the Plautine phrase
is nemo homo, not nemo hominum (Ter. Eun. 757). (On the Hiatus after
homo see Introd. ii. ξ 40.) The form qai presents a difficulty, for this Abl.
(or Instrumental) is normally used as a Pronoun rather than a Pronominal
Adjective, and in no other line does it play the part of an Abl. after a
Comparative. For all that, to change the ‘lectio difficilior' of the MSS.
qui lzomz'ne into quo lcomz'see is of doubtful expediency. The use of qui
(Interrog. Pron.) as Abl. Abs. in Bacch. 335, Sed qai praesente id aarum
Theotimo datumst .?, is similarly an isolated example. Such lines as Cas.
