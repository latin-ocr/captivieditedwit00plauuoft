11. PROSODY. 51

(Berl. Phil. Woch. xvi. 847) discredits the total suppression by elision of i, ‘go,’
in the Dramatists. e.g. Poen. 1116, Epid. 164. The Classical poets avoid the
elision of words like sim, qui Plur„ do, re, dem, rem, &a (see Luc. Mueller Res
Met1·.2 p. 399 for details). Plautus normally scans tum-t(u)-i9itur (see Luchs in
Hermes, 1874, p. 105); qu(em)-ad-m0dum (perhaps qu-e‘m ᾰά modum? Mil. 186),
e.g. Mer-c. 352 (bacch.) ; t(am)·etsi (cf. Lucil. v. 8 Μ.) ; qu(am)-ob-rem (but quam-
nam-ob-rem, Mil. 360). Amph. 552, Pseud. 244 are in Bacchiae mette, the
metre that permits cb‘epi (ξ 15).

42. From Metrical and Prosodic Hiatus we pass to Hiatus
proper. This is found in Plautus in various circumstances :—

(3) before or after an Interjection (cf. C. F. Miiller, Plaut. Pros.
723), e.g.
Truc. 161 Ο J Astaphium, haud istoc modo solita es me ante

a ellare.
Meg-{³731 eu 1 hercle, mulier, multum et audax 61 mala es,

Such hiatus is a feature of classica] Latin poetry also.

(4) at a change of speaker, e.g.

Most. 798 Ut istas remittat sibi. Ι Haud opinor.
Pom. 698 Complexum contrectare. Ι Is, 16116, uiam.

For other exanimes, see Klotz, Grundzffqe, p. 111. Of. the Greek usage,
e.g. Soph. Ο. C'. 1757 (anap.): Πατρὸς ἡμετέρου. Ι Ἀλλ’ ού θεμιτόν. We have also
Syllaba Anceps at a change of speaker (ξ 33).

The ground for the tolerance of Hiatus and Syllaba Anceps here is the same
as in the case of Metrical Hiatus, the pause at the close of the first speaker’s
remark. At the end of a line a final vowel stands without necessity of elision
though the next line begins with a vowel, because there is a marked interval
between the end of one line and the beginning of the next. For the same
reason a short syllable might play the part of a long syllable at the end of a line
because the following pause made up for its defective quantity. In the middle
of a long line, at the end of the first hemistich, there was a possibility of a break
of the same kind, though the break was not of constant occurrence as at the
end of the whole line, nor, when it did occur, of so marked a character. Hence
it comes that at this part of the line we have either, on the one hand, hiatus
and syllaba anceps, or, on the other, elision. With elision, there would be no
perceptible break between the two halves of the line, as there would be none in
such lines¹ as the Iambic Octonarii of Amph. 250—262‚ which describe in
rapid narration the battle between the Thebans and the Teleboi‚ and which
generally lack Diaeresis (iii. g 12). There is a similar break between the

¹ We may compare two lines of Tennyson’s ‘ Locksley HalL’ the first without,
the second with a break at the end of the heniistich :

“Many a night from yonder ivied casement ere I went 10 rest
Did Ι look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.‘'
