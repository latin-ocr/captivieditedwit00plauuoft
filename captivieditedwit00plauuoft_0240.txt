dic quad est, &c.‚ but dice before an initial vowel or when there is anythjng
of a pause after the word, eg. Reid. 124 A. Tu, siquid opus est, dice.
B. Dic quod te rogo. Even in Terence face is the form used at the end
of a line. Fer, it should be noticed, belongs to a different category; for
this was a Verb of the Athematic Conjugation in Indo-European and (like
es Imper. of sum) never had a final -ἔ, The reading of the MSS. may be
retained if we pronounce dice as dic, or if we scan dice dewwnstra by the
Law of Breves Breviantes (cf. the note on esse seit v. 350). But in Mil. 256
we have dice, monstra, praecipe:
eam iube
Cito domum transire, atque haec ei dice, monstra, praecipe.

360. Ad patrem. Cf. ad v. 400. Vin uocem. “This paratactic
construction is used 23 times in Plaut. (Cape. 858, Pseud. 324, 522, &c.),
always with lst pers„ while uin me faeere is used only three times.''
Morris.

Act ΙΙ. Scene iii. For Scene—heading we should expect merely
EIDEM (cf. the heading of Π. 11.) ; and indeed the only reason for making
a new Scene begin here is the change of metre, a consideration that ought
to tell equally at V. 385. The interview, now that the critical stage has
been passed, takes the quieter metre of Iambic Senarii, but when the time
comes for the impressive leave-taking between Philocrates and Tyndarus,
it becomes again Trochaic Septenarii (V. 385). The dialogue in this last
part, where the play almost rises to the level of Tragedy, is very skilfully
arranged. All that Tyndarus says to Philocrates has a double meaning,
which would be appreciated by the audience, but would be unlikely to
arouse suspicion in Hegio.

361. Quae res bene uortat, a common formula, eg. Aul. 787 (at a
betrothal) quae res tibi et ,ornatae tuae Bene feliciterque uortat. Cf. Virg.
leel. ix. 6 quod ησσ vertat bene.
