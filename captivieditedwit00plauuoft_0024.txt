quotes in his Adversaria from various plays (A sin„ Capti„ Cas„ Oura,
Illost„ Pom„ Pseud„ leuel„ Stich), a full collation of its text in the
Persa and Poenulus, in the first half of the Budens (to about V. 790),
the second half of the Pseudolus (from about v. 730), and in parts
of the Bacchides (circ. VV. 35—80, 570-650, elo—900). has been
preserved in the margins of a sixteenth century edition of Plautus
in the Bodleian Library‚ Oxford. An account of the Codex Turnebi

and a photographic facsimile of this collation are given in my Codex·
Turnebi of Plautus, Oxford‚ 1898 (cf. Class. Rev. xiii. 254).

3. Three other MSS„ written in Germany, are descended from
Ι, a common original (Ρ). It must have been a transcript made from

‘⁶ PA at a later time than the 'P-text was transcribed. For in four

passages of the Ruclens (VV. 648 sqq„ 666 sqq„ 698 sqq., 712 sqq),
where the torn sides of two leaves in PA left a lacuna at the
beginnings and ends of the lines, the scribe of P seems to have
found less than the scribe of 'I' (or of the original from which 'I'
was copied). V. 700, for example, Ne iozdiynuvn id habeas etc.
began with the word habeas in P, but with indigynum id habeas in ¹1¹.
One may conjecture, but it is no more than a conjecture, that PA had
been transmitted from France to Germany for the purpose of being
copied for a German monastery library and had suffered in the
transmission. The number of lines to a page in PA may be inferred
from the lacunae in the Rudens and other plays to have been from
19 to 21 (see g 13). N ineteen is the uniforn] number of lines to a
page in the Ambrosian Paliinpsest 3 and that PA was in Oapital script
like the Ambrosian Palinlpsest is suggested (hardly proved) by the
fact that in P the letter h, which has in the capital script of the
Alnbrosian Palimpsest and other Latin MSS. a K-form, was often
confused with the letter lv. Some of its spellings, ,leaeo for haec, huic
for huia, &a (Bacch. 105, 108, 110, 169 &c.), have been faithfully
reproduced in the Codex Vetus (B) (see below). The number of
lines to a page in P itself was apparently 33 (see below).

4. In dealing with the descendants of P it will be convenient
to discuss separately MSS. of the first eight plays (Aonph.—-Epid.‚
with the exclusion of the Bacchides) and MSS. of the last twelve¹
(luteola—Tque), For at some timo or other the text'2 had been

¹ The last part of ΡΑ containing the Vidulum-ia had been lost. P ended with
