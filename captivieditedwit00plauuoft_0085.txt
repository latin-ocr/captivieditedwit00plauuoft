111. METRE. 61

Dimeter Catalectic (princeps in Amoris vias), whereas to Aristo-
phanes V. 299 of the Lysistrata was an Iambic Tetrameter Acatalectic
with ‘ syncope' of the first thesis of the third ‘ metrum ' (τοοῦτο πάσῃ
μηχανῇ)-

That curious ‘Anaclasis' of Iambic metre, whereby a Choriambus
(-υυ-) takes the place of an [ambio metrum (ῦ-υ-), which
appears in the Greek choruses (and on special occasions even in
dialogue-passages, eg. Παρθενοπαῖῖος and φαιοχίτωινες), was probably
not practised by Plautus. (On its use in Greek see Wilamowitz
Herc. Fur. ii. p. 190.)

Nor have we reason to think that Plautus allowed a piece of
prose to break the continuity of his verse, as Aristophanes did, e.g.
Eq. 941 εὖ γε νὴ τὸν Διά καὶ τὸν Ἀπόλλω καὶ τὴν Δήμητρα.

But the Epiphonema, i.e. extra-metrical Interjection or address,
eg. Nub. init. :

ἰοὺ ἷοὺ,
ὦ Ζεῦ βασιλεῦ, τὸ χρῆμα τῶν νυκτῶν ὅσον,
is familiar to Plautus, eg. Cas. 619 :
attat,
quid illi'ic clamoris, obsecro, in nostrast domo?

(Cf. Epid. 181, Ter. Phorm. 485. Mar. Vict. 85 attests this usage.)

Some would find a syncopated Iambic Octonarius in Cas. 168 : nam ubi domi
sola sum sopor manus caluitur (usually scanned as a Cretic Tetrameter); a
syncopated Trochaic Trimeter Catalectic in Cas. 731: Α. 1'1t ego opinor nisi
resistis. B. Ὠ Ζεῦ (probably an Ionic Trimeter); a syncopated Iambic
Septenarius in Cure. 102: nam ubi tii prosusu's, ibi ego me peruelim sepffltam;
an Iambic Octonarius wit-h one ‘anaclastic' metrum in Τνιίι. 247: ibi illa
pendentem ferit; i(am) amplifis oram non satis. (On the ⁴ Choriambo-Iambics ’
of Ter. Ad. 1v. iv. see§ 46.)

The question how far strophio arrangement can be found in Plautus’ Cantica
is dismissed by Klotz, Grundzz‘z‘qe, p. 305; cf. Leo, Plaut. Cant„ p. 77.

5. The Colometry (in unscicntific language‚ the arrangement in
lines) of Plautus' Cantica, an arrangement which has been referred
with some probability to the end of the second century κο. (Leo,
Plaut. Cant. 6), is not always easy to determine. The two ancient
recensions of the text which are represented by our two families of
MSS. (1. g 17) seem occasionally to have difl'ered in this point. Thus
Pseud. 1329-30 appear in the ‘A111br0sian' recension as a long
Bacchiae series ε

A. Quid nunc? numquid iratus es aut mihi alit filio prop-
-ter has res, Simo? B. Nil profecto.
