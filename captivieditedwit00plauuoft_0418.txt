Not the least attractive and remarkable feature of this book will be the magnificenee
of its illustrations No more complete representation of the art of any painter has
ever been produced on the same scale. The owners of Sir John Millais’
most famous pictures and their copyrights have generously given their consent
to their reproduction m his biography, and, 1n addition to those pictures with which
the public 15 familiar, over two hundred pictures and sketches which have never
beenp reproduced before and which, in all probability will never be seen
again by the general public, will appear in these p.ages The early chapters
contain sketches made by Millais at the age of seven. There follow some
exquisite drawings madey by him during his Pre- Raphaelite period, a large
number os sketches and studies made for his great pictures‚ water colour
sketches, pen· ·and- ink sketches, and drawings, humorous and serious. 'lhere are
ten portraits of Millais himself, including two by Mr. Watts and Sir Edward
Burne Jones. There is a portrait of Dickens, taken aster death, and a sketch of
D. G. Rossetti. Thus the book will be not only a biography of high interest and
an important contribution to the history of English art, but in the best sense of
the word, a beautiful picture book.
