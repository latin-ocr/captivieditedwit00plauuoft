34 INTRODUCTION.

20. (2) Polysyllabic words. A syllable with naturally short
vowel is often not lengthened by ‘position' before a consonant-
group, when the following syllable (occasionally the preceding)
bears the accent of the word, and when the preceding syllable is
short, eg. ministerium, uoldptcitem, adcffptcicu& ddcffptaticius (Poen.
1045).

No matter what that group may be, eg. rn in 9ubc⁷rwzdbmzt, nt in uolffntdtis,
st in ministerium, uenffstdci, 11 in supellectilis, ss in vicissatim. It is wrong to
say that the shortening is especially found before a double consonant, e.g. ll, ss,
and to arsrue from the mere orthographical practice of writing a double conso-
nant single in early Latin (as in early Greek) inscriptions that the pronunciation
of a double consonant was weaker in the early than in the classical period.
Nor does the division ot' the two consonants between different syllables, e.g.
τΙη, nlt, IV, or the inclusion of both in the same syllable, eg. Ast, make any per-
ceptible difference. Statistics of this shortening in polysyllabic words are given
by Esch: de Plauti correptione sec-undae syllabae vocabulorum polysyllaborwm
quae mensura iambica incipiunt. Miinster, 1897.

The instances of shortening a naturally long vowel in such
words are very rare, but perhaps too well attested to be put aside,
eg. pudicitiam (Amph. 930, Epid. 405), verebamini Phorm. 902

(V. l. veremini), Clytaemestra Liv. Andr. Traq. ll R.

Shortenings like calefacere are common enough. But they belong as much
to the class of iambic words as of polysyllables. We may write calefacere (cf.
Lucr. vi. 962 etfacit are) or calffueere, as bene facere or benefacere. Of. die-
quince (Gell. x. 24), videlicet (eg. Stich. 557; but ἒ in Asin. 599). For a full
list of instances 1111(Ι pudicitia, sce Skutsch, Iambenkiirzuny und Syw‘zese in

‘Satura Viadrflmss b’reslau 1896. Eseh however disallows them (cf. Journ.
Phil. xxii. 1).

With these polysyllabic words we may associate

21. (3) Polysyllabic word-groups. The phrase uoluptas mea,
‘my darling,' seems to have been pronounced as a single word, like
respublica or jusj‘ecrmzdum„ with accent on the antepenultimate
syllable of the compound, i.e. on the last syllable of voluptas. The
preceding syllable is invariably scanned short by Plautus, uoluptas-
mea. Similar word-groups that occasionally exhibit the action of
the Law of breves Breviantes are: molehme-swa (Mil. 69) 3 Ἰηοιίἔειὶ-
sint (Trin. &31 ,Semper mendicis malesei sint: Anap.); quod
dryadum? in Curc. 613 ε

Quod argentum? quas tsi mihi tricas narras? quam tu uir-
ginenl?
