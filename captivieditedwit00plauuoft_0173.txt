Ita nunc belligerant Aetoli cum Aleis;

(O. I. L. i. 1011): Quadrayinta annos nata necis potior. The Deponent
(as opposed to the Active and Passive) form is rarer with undesirable
things, eg. Eud. 190 laborem hunc potiri, Ter. Phorm. 469 ne quid...
poteretur mali (cf. ad v. 218). Ergasilus should go on to say that no
substitute for his young patron could be found; but he wanders off into
other matters, and does not give us this information till v. 104.

93. Of. v. 24 and note. Ita (see note on v. 674).

94. Nam Aetolia haec est. See p. 112. It seems unlikely that we
should have in the same line two unpleasing rhythms like illlic e'sc οάρῐίᾶε
in Alcide. ‘Imo'st' or ‘illic'st' is a pronunciation that seems not to be
recognized by Plautus (lntrod. ii. ξ 12), and it is highly improbable that the
last syllable of captus could be elided (Introd. ii. ξ 3). lllz'e is not in itself
objectionable, for ille often is used where is would be expected, eg. Epz'd.
267 fidicinam Illam, quam is uolt liberare, quae illum conrumpit tibi. To
change the unfamiliar form illic into the familiar ille is contrary to the
laws of textual criticism. But if we remember the tendency of our scribes
to change illi Adv. to illic (see note on v. 60), we shall see that the
alteration illi est captus involves the least departure fron] the traditional
reading, especially as we have the Adverb in V. 330, a close parallel to this
line: Filius meus illz‘[c] apud uos seruit captus Alide. The end of the line
would be most simply emended, if emendation were necessary, by supposing
in to be a gloss, at first written above Alide to explain the unfamiliar use
of the Ablative, and subsequently copied into the text. The rule of
Classical Latin that the Preposition should be used with names of countries
and omitted with names of towns is not strictly followed by Plautus.
Thus we have in this play Alide, ‘in Elis' (v. 330), Alidem, ‘to Elis'
(v. 573), though usually in Alide (vv. 9, 26, 544, 547, 590, 638, 973, 979)
and in Alidem (vv. 379, 588), ex Alide (vv. 510, 1005, 1014). Redslob
thinks it possible that Plautus thought of Elis as a town and not as a
country. A more certain example of the name of a country is Most. 440
Triennio post Aeyypto aduenio domum (cf. Trzoe. 540). Plautus can also
dispense with the Preposition in phrases like saxo saliat Trin. 265, officio
migrat Trin. 639. An old inscription of 189 ΒΩ. (GLL. 1. 534) has Aetolia
cepit, apparently meaning ‘took from Aetolia! And a line quoted from
the θείῳ-«κῃ of Livius Andronicus by Festus (p. 162, 24 Th), of text fairly
certain, though not above suspicion, has : Partim errant, nequinont Graeciam
redire, ‘ they stray in companies and cannot win back to Greece.’
