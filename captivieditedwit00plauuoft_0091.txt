111. METRE. 67

rule has also been stated in this form: ‘Before a final polysyllable which is
commensurate with 30 Iambic ‘ metrum’ a spondee-word or word-ending with
clash of ictus and accent is tolerated.¹

Elision redeems the rhythmical fault. No exception is taken to 3 line like
uin cdmmut(em) aurem? niam 090 ducam et τᾶ meam? Elision in the last foot of
311 Iambic Senarius is not much favoured by Roman Dramatists, e.g. BIen.
898 quam r(em) ayat. (For details, see Klotz, Grzmdziiye, p. 247.) Two
spondee-words (or word-endings) with clash of ictus and accent are never found
together, e.g. ‘consuL censor' (Klotz, p. 327). On monosyllabic endings of
lines see ἕ 6.

8. Spondees play a great part in the lines of the Roman
Dramatistsl. The fifth foot is more frequently a spondee than
anythjng else, so that the ‘Law of the Cretic' observed by the
Greek Tragedians2 is quite unknown in Latin Comedy 01· Tragedy.
The fifth foot may be an iambus only in the line-endings (l) ‚ υ - ψ Ξ,
(2) υ, - υ Ξ3, e.g. imaqi‘nem, ubi ambules, ‘iamque se-daret, and
occasionally (3) υ(,)υυ-, υΞ, e.g. reuelnizint domum, in alliam
diem, erus olperdm dare. (On this occasional ending see Luchs 111
Studemund's Studien auf dem Gebiete des Archaischen Lateins 1. i.)
But an iambic line (senarius, Octonarius, dte.) or hemistich may not
end with two iambus-words (which indeed are avoided 31 any part
of the line 3 cf. Klotz, Grundzuye, p. 2373 Seyffert in Berl. Phicoc.
Wochensclzrzfl xviii. 976), nor with 311 iambic ending followed by an
iambus-word. Thus Cape. 5 Sed is quo pacto seruiat suo sibi patri
would not be metrical if we changed the ending 130 suf> sibi seruicia
patr-{5 nor Poen. 1334 in seruitute 1110 filias habuit tuas, if the
order were habuit filicis ιᾰᾶε.

The ending malam crucem is allowed to end a line, because the phrase 000-
stituted 3 single word-group, being capable of taking an attributive Adjective,
e.g. maxumam malam crucem :

Cas. 611 Ducas easque in maxumam malam crucem.

The reason why two iambus-words were avoided was probably that the recurrent
discrepancy between metrical ictus and word-accent was unpleasing. In Amph.
991 Pater vocat me the last two words would probably be pronounced together
with accent on the last syllable of vocat, owing to the enclitic nature of
the Pronoun, vocat-me. So bonan fide is allowed to end an Iambic line,
because bonan had the accent on the last syllable, Most. 670 Το05 emit aedis

1 In the Greek New Comedy too we find Spondees in thc odd fect (especially
the third and fifth) rather more frequently than Iambic and Trisyllabic feet
together. In Seneca’s Tragedies the fifth foot is, we may say, always a Spondee.
(Cf. Diomedes, p. 507 K.: Iambus tragicus. 1110, ut gravior iuxta materiae
pondus esset, semper quinto loco spondeum recipit.)

² Not by the Greek Comedians to the same extent.

³ By a comma is indicated the ending osa word.
