PREFAOE.

Since the Captivi is the one play of Plautus in whose text
are represented 3,111 the pre-Renaissance MSS, I have thought
it worth while to re-collate the MSS.2 for this edition and
provide a full apparatus criticus. The gleaning of the field
already reaped by the authors of the larger Teubner edition
has not been mis-spent labour. It has contributed not merely
· to the improvement of the text, especially in the matter of
orthography³‚ but to a clearer knowledge of the relationship
between the MSS. of the first eight plays.

The introductory pages deal mainly with Prosody and
Metre‚ the two subjects on which information seems most
required by English students of Plautus. I hope in time to
edit other plays of this author and to take up one by one the
remaining topics of interest, such as Plautine Accidence and
Syntax, and the history of the Plautine Text in antiquity.

To Professor Skutsch of Breslau University my best thanks
are due for the help I have received from him in the prepara-

tion of this volume.

¹ With the exception of G, which contains only the last twelve plays.

2 For the Ambrosian Palimpsest the Apograph of Studemund is and must
always be the final court of appeal.

³ The orthography which an editor of Plautus seeks to reproduce is that of
the ancient reeension from which all our MSS. are ultimately derived. This
recension would, in all likelihood‚ exhibit earlier and later forms side by side,
e.g. aequissumus and aequissimus, aequos, aequs, aecus and even aequus. The
MSS. are far from being infallible guides in this matter3 but their consisteney
in such spellings as optumus (cf. occupo), mininms (cf. incipio), shews that
adherence to their best tradition is safer policy than an arbitrary selection of,
let us say, -umus as the only permissible form of the Superlative ending.
