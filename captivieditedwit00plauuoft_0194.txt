166 PLAVTI GAPTIVI. [174--176

Sed quid tu id quaeris? ERG. Quia mi est natalis dies :
Propterea <a> te uocari ad te ad cenam uolo. 175
HEG. Facete dictum. Sed si pauxillum potes

174. quid tu BD: quid diu VEJ queris libri (corr. E) ΗΕΘ. libri:
corr. Spengelius mihi (michi E) est libri 175. te uoc. ad te nam uolo libri
(em te uoc. ad. te ad nam 11010 B: te uoc. ad cenam uolo J ): corr. Schoellius

Dmmatists, eg. Ter. Adel. 246 nusquam abeo (see note on v. 192). Quod
sciam is common in Plautus, after positive as well as after negative
statements‚ eg. Most. 1010 Α. Alina-5 quadraginta accepisti, quod sciam,
A Philolachete. B. Numquam nummum, quod sciam.

175. The birthday feast was given by the person whose birthday was
celebrated. Ergasilus wishes to vary the practice. The point of the joke
would be lost, if we followed the MSS. in assigning sed...cenam (vv. 172-—3)
to Hegio, nusquam...quae7·is (vv. 173—4) to Ergasilus, and quia, &c. to
Hegio We have a description of natalicicle dapes in Pers. 768 sqq.
(cf. Pseud. 165 sqq.) Ad te ad cenam. See note on v. 831. The
scribes of our MSS. have found difficulty in the transcription of the phrase
in this line, as also in Mil. 712, Stich. 511.

176. Facete dictum, ‘well put,’ a current phrase, eg. Poen. 637, Ter.
Eun. 288. Of. Cic. Off. i. 29. 104 facete diota...quae vocant ἀποφθέγματα.
Pauxillum, ‘you must shew just a little eontentment.' The reading is
very doubtful. Paum‘llo, which Lambinus ascribes 10 his ‘veteres libri'
(an authority that is sometimes valueless, sometimes most valuable), is
adopted by most editors, and is what we should expect to find with
contentus esse, ‘to be content with very little’ Since -um had come in
Late Latin to be pronounced -O (ef. Ital. vino for Lat. vinum), mediaeval
scribes were familiar with the misspelling —() for -um and often changed -o
to -um without cause. Thus malo may have been Wrongly changed to malum
in Bacch. 463, caue malo (malum MSS), by some scribe who did not know
the Plautine construction of caveo with the Dat. (eg. l'ers. 369 malo cauere
meliust te). But would a scribe be likely in this line to change the easily
intelligible pauxillo contentus esse to the ‘lectio difficilior' pauxillum?
If we read parandae in this line, we should read pao-pauxillo in the next
line. This reading has the support of a correction in one MS„ which
however is clearly due to the following modo. The archetype, we may be
sure, had peopczuoeillzlm. Leo defends peopuzhzillum (beside pauxillo of
this line> by the supposition that Ergasilus is punning 011 1110 two senses
of esse, as in l'i‘dzcl. 37 sq. ι

A. Heus tu, a ineis illie estur <satis duru>s c<ibus>.
B. Misero male esse <fuerit> consentaneum.
