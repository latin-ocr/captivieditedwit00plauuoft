11. ⁵ pnosonv. 53

(a) emphatic reiteration¹‚ ἀφ, eg.

Pseud. 673 hic argentum‚—hic amanti amica erili filio (A P).
Cure. 46 eam uolt meretricem facere : Ι ea me deperit (P, A η. ί. ).

(b) asynthetic details of any kind ², eg. Merc. 745 ε
uidere, amplecti, Ι osculari, Ι adloqui (P, A n. L),
Men. 476 prandi, potaui, scortum accubui, Ι abstuli (AF).

(c) When a letter is read aloud. When one thinks of the
traditional way of reading aloud a letter on the modern stage,
the pauses occasioned by the pretended difficulty of deciphering the
writing, or by the affectation of incredulity or of astonishment at what
the letter is found to contain, οι· by the meaning glances directed at
the audience, one persuades oneself that the numerous cases of
hiatus in passages like vv. 756 sqq. of the Asinaria may have really
come from Plautus himself. The Parasite is reading to Diabolus
the draft of the proposed contract with Diabolus' mistress, and,
I fancy, emphasizes in the earlier part the different provisions of the
contr-act by appropriate pauses :—

Alienum hominem Ι intro mittat neminem.

Quod illa afit amicum Ι aut patronum n6minet,
Fores occlusae Ι omnibus sint nisi tibi.

In foribus scribat occupatan] Ι esse se (P, A η. l.).

Under this category may be mentioned Hiatus with eccum, ‘ecce hunc‚’ ‘see
him here!,’ and like words, which is strongly attested by the MSS. more than

once 2

(1) after eccum,

Most. 686 Euge optume eccum Ι aedium dominus foras
Simo progreditur (ΑΡ).
Men. 567 Atque edepol eccum Ι &ptume reuertitur (ΑΡ).
Cas. 536 Sed eccum Ι egreditur senati columen praesidium popli (ΑΡ).

(Cf. Pers. 392, ?P‹¹rs. 226, ?Mo.s·t. 1127. Add Capt. 169, and see note);

(2) before eccum (less strongly attested),

Most. 560 Sed Philolachetis seruom Ι eccum Trimium (P, A n. 1.).

Cure. 278 Vide6 currentem Ι ellum usque in platea ultima (P, A u. I.).
Men. 286 Peniculum Ι eccum in uidulo saluom fero (P, A π. l.).

Aul. 781 ιιὶωῑῐιο Ι eccillam domi (P, A τι. L).

Stich. 260 Ventri reliqui Ι eccam quac dimit ‘cedo’ (A, eccam illam P).

1 Cf. Virg. laec. viii. 41 ut vidi, ut perii, Ι ut me malus abstulit error, Ecl. x.
13 illum etiam lauri, Ι etiarn flevere myricae.

² If the long vowel in hiatus was shortened, there will be no ‘irrational’ thesin
in these Cretics, Most. 152: arte gymnaeistica, diseo, Ι hastis, pila, cursu, Ι armis,
equo uictitabizm uolup.
