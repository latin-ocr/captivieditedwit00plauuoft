Ι. THE MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. 9

And the same neglect of the ‘rubricator’ to supply Scene-
headings, ‘notae personarum,' and the marks O and DV reappears
in various descendants of ΡΑ from time to time, and has led to the
almost total disappearance of the ‘ notae personarum⁷ and these
marks from our MS&

The same type of Scene-headings is found in the Codex Bembinus
(5th cent.) of Terence. The Didascaliae of the Bembinus shew the
same variety of lines in red and black. Of the Plautine Didascaliae
we have only two examples (Studemund in Commentationes Momm-
samanae), those of the Stichus and Pseudolus in A, where the black
lines only remain, the red lines having been washed out. In PA the
Didascaliae seem not to have been present.

15. The Arguments prefixed to the plays of Plautus are of two
kinds, Acrostic and non-Acrostic. In PA the Acrostic Arguments
were used, with the addition occasionally (Amph, Aul„ lisere„ Mil.)
of the non-Acrostio2. In A no Arguments were written by the
scribe, but non-Acrostic Arguments have been added in a later
(5th century) hand in Uncial script wherever a suitable blank space
was available (Pera, Pseud, Stich).

16. The Order of the Plays is different in A and ΡΑ, though
the arrangement in alphabetic groups is the same. The M-group in
A follows this order: Mero„ illest„ Mil„ Blera. 3 in ΡΑ, Most„
Men„ Mil„ Alere, the P-group in A, Poen„ Pers„ Pseud.3 in ΡΑ,
Pseud„ Poen„ Pers. The position of the Bacchides after the
Epidicus in our minuscule MSS. (due to the reference to the
Epidicus in Bacch. 214) is probably later than ΡΑ, to judge from the
gap at the end of Aul. and beginning of Bacch.

17. Besides these differences of A and PA with regard to
Golometry, Scene-headings, Didascaliae, Arguments, and Order of
Plays, there are ‹liffei‘ences of text. From the remarks of the
Grammarians and Lexicographers of the Empire we can see that
varieties of text, in other words various editions of Plautus, were
prevalent3 and some of these varieties we find reproduced in A

¹ Through the greater part of the Trinmnnnffi, however, the ‘notae perso-
narum' are retained in B, viz. A for Megaronides, B for Callicles, A (Iey. M) for
Philto, E for Lesbonicus, Z for Lysiteles, Κ for Stasimus. For the remains of
the marks C and DV which occasionally poi-siet even in the 12th century MSS.
see Ritschl, Opnsc. iii. pp. 1 sqq. and add to 1113 list those os the Codex Turnebi
and of the Leyden 12tl1 century MS. (V) (366 Schoell's edition of the Casina).

² That these came from the margin into the text is suggested by 1116 fact
that in Amph„ Aul„ they precede, but in Mero„ Mil„ follow the Acrosstic.
