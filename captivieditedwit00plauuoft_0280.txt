Tyndarus and Aristophontes were together. Tyndarus probably retreats
after his declaration that Aristophontes was regarded as a madman in Elis
(cf. v. 733).

548. Fabuletur. (For the Mood, see note on v. 363.) This Verb
does not mean ‘to speak 1100501150,> though fabulae (like Zoyi, ‘mere words')
is used interjectionally like our ‘ Nonsense !’ It means merely ‘to speak'
(cf. Tria. 480 Rem fabulare, ‘exactly !,' lit. ‘you speak fact⁷) and still
survives in Romanae in Spanish ‘hablar‚’ the equivalent of French
‘parler' (late-Lat. parabolare) and Italian ‘dire' (Lat. dicere). Spain, be
it remembemd, became a Roman province about the time of Plautus.
Auris inmittas tuas. Epid. 335 neque 690 id iri aures immitto meas.
Whether the spelling of the single MS. E is sufficient authority for
printing immitam, instead of immittas in this line, is open to doubt. For
the construction cf. v. 149 istac„‚camimum induxis ticum.

550. Morbus, the ‘comitialis morbus⁷ (so called because its occurrence
was regarded as a bad omen, and caused a suspension of the proceedings at
the Comitia) or ‘morbus caducusss our epilepsy. Qui insputatur.
The late-Latin confusion of isp, imp, sp, &cn (eg. late—Latin Spania for
Hispania, {scola for sclicla, Sec.) so often shows itself in our MSS. that the
change of qui spatario· to qai imputatio· (cf. 553, 555) is a very legitimate
one. ‘The disease which is spit upon’ is put for ‘the diseased person
who,' &c.; cf. Plin. H. N. xxviii. 4 despuimus comitiales morbos, lioc est
contagia regrerz'mas. For the remedy, cf. ibid. x, 23 comitialem propter
morbum despui suetum.

551. Ultro istum a me, so. amovete, addi-ossed to the slaves, who, in
accordance with Hegio's instructions (v. 456), are keeping watch on
Tyndarus. Or it may mean merely ‘1 won't have anything to do with
him.² Cf. Amph. 320 Ultro istmzo qui eaeossat homines, Cas. 459 Ultro
te, amator, apaye te. Ain, uerbero‘? The punctuation should bc put
after uei-bero, to judge from lines like 892, Asin. 485 (guid, uer-bero? ain
