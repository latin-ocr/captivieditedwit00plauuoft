HEG. Propemodum ubi loci fortunae tuae sint facile

958. Propemodum, to judge from its Plautine use, has much the
same sense as facile. For the repetition ef. eg. Mero. 67 extemplo*
confestim.

959. Tua ex re facies—ex mala meliusculam. The last words
seem to be added as an afterthought and are not quite in keeping with
tua ex re facies, ‘you will benefit yourself ' (eg. Men. 661 ecc re tua feceris).
They would naturally have as a preliminary tuam rem, ‘you will put your
affairs out of a bad into a slightly better condition? The Prepesition ow
has a slightly different sense in the two parts of the sentence (ef. ad
v, 928). Leo pimetuates after re:

si eris ueremi, tua ex re, facies ex mala meliusculam,

leaving facies to be supplied in the first phrase. The words ex mala
meliusculam have been with much likelihood assigned to Stalagmus. In
that case they will be the incentive to Hegio's rejoinder reete et uera. loquere
(Ind.)‚ which, as the passage is printed in this edition, is a command
(loquere Imper.). Brix boldly transfers vv. 958—9 to the place of v. 968, so
that v. 960 follows immediately on vv. 955-—7.

960. Recte et uera. Ter. Ad. 609 Ec recte et uerum dicis. For the
combination of Adverb and Adjeetive in colloquial Latin cf. v, 271, Triu.
268 Sunt tamen quos miseros maleque habeas, Pseud. 110, Asin. 567 sq. The
defective metre is easily remedied by the insertion of the pronoun tu,
which should be joined immediately to the Negative, for neque 0190, neque
tu (sometimes with the intervention of hercle, edepol, διο.) is the normal
arrangement in Plautus, eg. Men. 960 Neque 690 insanio neque puynas
neque 690 litis coepio (for other examples see Kaempf, de pronominum
Personalium Usu et Collocatz'one, Berl. 1886, p. 41). Tu would more easily
drop out before u of uere than before recte. Resides, the ictus will fall on
tu in this position in the line, and that suits the emphasis which would
attach to the Pronoun in this sentence. Schoell places ια after the second
neque and before recte.
