this context to play ‘che same metrical part, in his line as bemus

would (Eun. prol. 8) :

Ex Graecis bonis Latinas fecii: non bonas.
The emphatic utterance of a short monosyllable (or elided disyllable)
similarly obscured the unstressed initia] syllable of the following
word, e. g. Allerc. 971 Verum hic dicit). Tibff') erqo djcit. ΕΦ) ‘ZlZde

18. To what: extent this assimilation of quantity to a preceding
shorb syllable was carried out in pronunciation would depend partly
on the speaker himself. An educated man would be less prone to
slur or weaken his syllables than an uneducated. The same speaker
in ordinary careless talk would pay less regard to their due, quanti-
tative pronunciation than he would in formal, ceremonious discourse.
To what extent] it should be recognized in poetry was of course
a matter for each individua] poet to decide, though in the case
of some words, as we have seen (eg. bene, male), the power of
decision was taken out of his hands 3 so strongly had popular usage
decl-ared for the shorbened form. Ennius in his Epic Poetry restricts
himself to the shortened pronunciation only of final vowels, in the
weakening of which another factor was at work, viz. the shortened
pronunciation of these before an initia] vowel (below, §38), and
mainly the final vowels of iambic words (in Ama. 63 Μ. ludier& is
probably Neub. Sg. of a 3 Decl. by-form 3 cf. ἓ 26), bhough we have
occasional scansions like vimine& (Anu. 102 M.; cf. Plaut. Pers.
845, if the reading be correct):

Virgines nam sibi quisque domi Romanus habeb sas.

Subsequent Dactylic Poets practise 'ohe same restrictiori and
make more and more sparing use even of these shortenings. But
every now and then bhey give us a glimpse of the real every-day
pronunciation by their occasional departures from the rules of classical
poetry 3 abest Lucil. ix. 29 Μ., viden (Virg.), cave* (Catull, Hor., Ovid),
υοίὄ (catull. vi. 16), dab& (Catull. xiii. 11), hom& (Lucr. vi. 652),
