192 sqq. Ergasilus leaves the stage by the right-hand door (from the
spectators; see p. 112) for the forum (v. 478). Hegio repeats his intention
of visiting the other batch of prisoners in his brother’s erqastulum (a visit
which leads to the discovery of the Captives' plot in Aet HL), but decides
to postpone it.

192. Intro...in‘bus. This line is a good illustration of the correct use
of these two Adverbs in accordance with Lucilius' rule (ix. 59 Μ.) :

Intro nos uocat ad sese, tenet intus apud se.

The use of intus for intro (motion to within), which is condemned by
Quintilian as a solecism (i. 5. 51 ‘eo ⁷ tamen ‘intus’ et ‘intro sum' soloe-
cismi sunt), is not found in Plautus (cf. Astu. 941). But intus is common
in another sense, of motion from within3 and that is the original sense
both of intus and of all Adverbs in -tus, e.g. penitus (Pseud. 132 Atque ipse
egreditur penitus, peiuri caput), funditus, radicitus, &Q The termination
(Greek -τος of ἐντός, ἐκτός) soon acquired the sense of rest within, the usual
sense of penitus and a common sense of subtus (eg. Cato R. R. xlviii. 2 uti
subtus homo ambulare possit), and indeed was extended till it became a
mere Adverbial ending without any local sense, e.g. publicitus, sollemnitus,
&Q subducam. Cure. 371 Beatus uideor: subolum· ratiunculam,
Quantum aeris mila· sit quantumque alieni siet: Diues sum, si nou reddo
eis quibus debeo. On the rhythm sublducaml, see v. 24.

193. Quantillum. Cf. Bacch. 320 nescio Quantillum attulerim uerum
haud permultum attulit. Apparently Hegio's purchases of Elean prisoners
(vv. 27, 98 sqq.) had been so extensive as to make him apprehensive of a
small balance of ready money at his banker's (cf. ratiunculam, v. 192). In
v. 449 he gives a clieque on his banker for Philocrates⁷ travelling expenses.
Tarpezitam. The Greek τραπεζίτης was in everyday language perverted
to tarpezita (tuopessita), a form required by the metre in three passages of
Plautus (Cure. 341, 406, 712) and possible in all, with one exception, Epid.
143 Dte modo unde aufe'rrc mc uis. ά quo trapezita pcto? Since the Pre-
position is usually put after the Interrogative in Plautus, it is extremely
probable that the true reading is quo a tcmpczz‘ta pcto, so that tarpezita,
although altered by scribes to trapezita, was in all likelihood the only form
recognized by Plautus. Others prefer to suppose both forins, trapezita and
tarpezita, to have been used by Plautus, as he uses leyyio (passim) and
l'lcyryt'o (Aut. 508) (cf. Introd. ii. ξ 10). Siet. The Optative Of sum
