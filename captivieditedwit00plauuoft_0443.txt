S. Baring Gould’s Novels

Crown 8vo. 65. each.

‘To say that a book is by the author of “Mehalah'’ is to imply that it contains a
story cast on strong lines, containing dramatic possibilitie5‚ vivid and sympathetic descrip-
tions of Nature, and a wealth of ingenious imagery.'—Speaker.

¹ That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a conclusion that may
be very generally accepted. His views of life are fresh and vigorous, his language
pointed and characteristic, the incidents of which he makes use are striking and original,
his characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional people, are drawn and
coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his descriptions of soenes and scenery are
painted with the loving eyes and skilled hands of a master of bisart, that he is always
fresh and never dull, and it is no wonder that readers have gained confidence in his
power of amusing and satisfying them, and that year by year his popularity widens.'—
