20 INTRODUCTION.

Bacch. 932. Instead of sais (cf. sas Nom.) in Cure. 323, editors read sueris3
‘ custodia’ of the MSS. they change to custodela (Mero. 233 and often3
of. Niemeyer on Capt. 457). Dicaea-m. (Gk. Δικαίαν), if this is the right form of
the name, is an anapaest in Mil. 808, with the same shortening of a diphthong
as in prehendo, platea, balineae (cf. gynaeceum, Most. 759). Even praehende with
long first syllable is not impossible in Cure. 339. Of the long scansions may
be noticed Diana Bacch. 312 (full details in Abraham stud. Plaut. p. 216), Dius
Fidius Asin. 23. The verb aio shews divergence of scansion. In the Present we
find usually quid ἄϊε, quid ἄϊε (see App. ξ 19), and in dialogue metres cas, ἅὶι,
eg. Poen. 1013, 1017, Rud. 1072, Asin. 285; but probably ἇῖη nel-mally, though
ᾶὶη may occur in Amph. 281 (cf. Leo ad loc.). In the Imperfect the uncertainty
of the spelling in our MSS. leaves us occasionally an open choice between
aiebam and (libam (ιῖῐὸαηιῖ) for the longer by—form of disyllabic ffibam. (On

these scansions in other poets see Luc. Mueller Res Mens-³ p. 285.) Quid ais tz‘c
(an anapaest), Poen. 343, is au unlikely shortening (ξ 16).

7. Unsyneopated forms. Valide (Most. 974, Pseud. 145)
appears instead of valde (for details see Gehlhardt‚ de Adverbiis‚ Halle,
1892, p. 21) ; puriyo, <0b)iuri90 are older forms of ραν-90, (οό)’ἱἰιν90
(31150111, Opusc. ii. 426); laridum (lardum, Lucil. 11. 14 M.) is the
only form known to Plautus (of. balineae, later bala). Of er (and

r)-f0r1ns alterinsecas seems to 000111· 111 spiere. 977, sinistera 111 Mero.
880 (Eun. 835), but supera (used by Lucretius 3 cf. [ηε. Tray. 163 R.)
is not established for Plautus (Cas. 815 15 doubtful) 3 much less
‘ altrum' (scan alteram in Capt. S &c.)‚ ‘ cetrum' : deoetera seems
to be used, eg. cedo cuam mi dea-teram Cure. 307, Mero. 149, as well
as deoetra, eg. cette claustras mmciam Mero. 965. Of u (and v)-forms
larua 15 always a trisyllable in Plautus, but Illinerz'c'a (Accius Traq.
127 R.) is open to doubt (see Schoell 111 Arch. Zac. Lexilcoqr. x. 116
011 Bacch. 893). 011 -(u)l- see ὲ 4.

Add opific-ina (Mil. 880) for class. officina. But Vid. 17 is not sufficient
evidence of ‘ usai-{post There 15 110110 of ⁴ aevitas' or ‘aeviternus-J

Acuu for aqua 15 another doubtful Plautine form (cf. Ine. Tray. 111 R. ; and
see Schroedcr iu Studeniuud's Studien ii. 20). So is acer-iios (CaS. 126 5³), and
samos (see Havct in ille‘moires Soc. Lirnyuistique vi. 115). Trisyllabic solito is
more likely. Brock‚ Quaest. (immin. p. 101, pleads for consiierant, dcc. Anticiius
seems to occur iu the post-Plautino prologue of thc Casina, vv. 7, 13 (cf. Bacch.
261?). REIz'euus 15 the Plautine scansion (rellqttus not till Persius).

Of syncopated forms the colloquial ardus for aridus is probably found in
Pers. 266 (Aul. 297). Some would add un'cus in σαμε. 321 (q.v.)‚ dom'nus in
Cas. 722 (see Leo 111 Rhein. Mus. xxxviii) Haut. 628. Surpui for surripui
occurs thrice iu 0110 play, the Captivi, but probably never ‘surpio,’ *θαι-110703
‘surptus,’ oze. (Journ. Phil. xxvi. 296). I’oryo is the Plautine form (Pseud.
708, δια), probably not ‘porriglo' (ἵ) Μο1·0. 883).
