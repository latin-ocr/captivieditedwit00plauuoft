11. PRosoDY. 17

Plautus and his contemporaries used a form sacer (sacri- 3 Decl.),
eg. porci sacres, ‘pigs for saorifice,' Eud. 1208 (cf. Men. 290). Cf.
rabidus Cas. 310, Stich. 228 3 rubrica Truc. 2943 tffyillum Rud. 576
(Aul. 301). Defi·atu⁷n (Pseud. 741) is the Plautine, defrutum the
Virgilian form (see Hilberg in Zeitschr. oesterreich. Gymnas. xxviii.
37). ιΗοτηόηἰζς ’ dxc. is now generally abandoned as un-Plautine.

We have evidence of statim (Lat. Lany. ix. ξ 4); and stritus, the Noun, is
found (Mil. 1389), usually status. But whether ἀᾶῑον may be admitted in Truc.
571 beside the usual dator is doubtful. On ibidem, rarely ibidem, see ἓ 16 η.

The Pronoun (296 (eg. Aul. 457, Cist. 745, Truc. 357, 454)
was still found along with the usual scansion 8ρό (eg. in line—
endings like ἑι 695 uos Mil. 11383 see Seyffert in Bursian's
Jahresber. 1894, p. 260>3 whereas only the pyrrich forms appear to
have been tolerated of the Adverbs bene, male, ita (ξξ 16). The older
Datives quoii, lmic were not wholly supplanted by the monosyllabic
pronunciation quoi or cui, huic (see the next paragraph). In the
Ablative and Accusative mid, te‘d, but probably not sed, were used
along with me, te (se) ; though in longer words final d after a long
vowel had been completely lost in pronunciation before the begin·
ning of Plautus' literary activity.

Possibly also the monosyllabic Noun red (Abl.), Aul. 141, Mero. 629, Pseud.
19, Pacuvius Tray. 237 R. (see Archiv zat. Lexikoyraphie x. 550). Sed is
found (with sessa) on old inscriptions. These old Pronoun ease-forms in -d
(cf. Maurenbrecher Hiatus 118) have been often, though not always, ‘ modernized '
by the scribes of our MSS„ except where some accident led to their preservatkm,
such as the confusion of ted esse with te desse (deesse). Where the metre shews
that se is the wrong form (eg. Asin. 583), editors rightly prefer to substitute sese
(which is osten mis-copied as se by scribes, eg. Cure. 298) rather than sech for
we have not the same indication of the form 8Ξά as we get of the forms med, 1ἑά
111 our MSS. The restoration of thc older ending d to Ablatives (eg. ayrod,
Amph. 193 ‘?), Adverbs (eg. porrod, introd) or Imperatives (ag. ιίατοά), that
contain more than one syllable, is a practice followed occasionally by editors
in imitation of Ritschl, but is almost certainly wrong (see Lat. Lany. ii. ξ 137 3
Maurenbrecher Hiatus p. 129). The Nom. Sing. of the Demonstrative Ιιῖο is
probably never a long syllable when the next word begins with a vowel (Scan
hic in Amph. 300, Capt. 547, &c.3 see ξ 32).

Τ118 Preposition re⁹<d)- (cf. Luc. Mueller Res Alffetrf’ p. 448) ·

retains its full length in the by-forms redduco (normal), reddum
(in two Bacchiae lines, Capt. 923, Eud. 909 ; otherwise reduce),
rellatum (Phorm. prol. 21), &07 but ‘recido Men. 520. l’ro in
Com'position shews both the long and the short vowel, not always
in accord with the classical usage, eg. pr5tervus Amph. 837, &a
(For details see Lat. thny. ix. ξ 45 ; cf. note on Cape. 923.)
