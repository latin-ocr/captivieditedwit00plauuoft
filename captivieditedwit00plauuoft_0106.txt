80 INTRODUCTION.

24. Anapaestic Monometers often stand at intervals within an Anapaestic
system in Greek, and very frequently are put before the last line (colon) for the
purpose of marking the close of the system. In the penultimate line, for
example, of a passage of the Thesmophoriazusae (vv. 824 sqq.) we have a παρα-
τέλευτον of this kind:

τοῖς δ’ ἡμετέροις ἀνδράσι τούτοις
ἀπόλωλεν μὲν πολλοῖς ὁ κανὼν 825
ἐκ τῶν οἴκων αὐτῇ λόγχῃ,
πολλοῖς δ’ ἑτέροις ἀπὸ τῶν ὤμων
ἐν ταῖς στρατιαῖς

ἔρριπται τὸ σκιάδειον. 829
Leo (Plaut. Cant. p. 25) arranges in corresponding fashion Stich. 328—330:
A. Tfibs inclama, tffi delinquont, 328
ego quid me uelles uisebam (328²)
nam me quidem harum miserebat. 329
B. Ergo auxilium propere latumst. (329⁸)
G. Quisnam hic loquitur 330

tam prope nos? B. Pinacium. C. Ubi is est? (330⁸)

although the Ambrosian Palimpsest agrees with the Palatine MSS. in writing
the passage in three long lines.

25. The Anapaestic Metre, which seems to have held its
ground to some extent even in the later Greek Comedy (ξ 2),
is the favourite metre of Plautus in his Cantica. Terence eschews
it entirely, through dislike, I fancy, of that clash of ictus and accent
which we have seen to be an inevitable accompaniment of Latin
Anapaests (g 21), and promotes the Iambic Octonarius to its place.

Anapaestic Metre in the Greek Dramatists often marks the solemn entrance
of the chorus or of a leading personage on the stage. Since however this metre
is the commonest metre in all the Cantica of Plautus, we are not warranted in
selecting a particular passage where an entrance of this 'kind is described, and
in supposing that Plautus was determined in his choice of this metre for this
passage by the same considerations as appealed to the Greek Dramatists. The
stock example of ‘march-anapaests’ in Plautus, viz. Trin. 840 sqq.:

sed quis hic est, qui in plateam ingreditur
cum nouo &rnatu specieque simul?
pol quamquam domi cupio, opperiar,
quam hic re'm agat animum aduertam,
should be discarded by our text-books on Metre.

Was sisenna referring to the Versus Reiziani of Aul. 111. ii. (quoted in ξ 49),
when he spokc of a scene of the Aulularia being composed of ‘concisa
anapaestica’? Cf. Sisenna ap. Rufin. p. 561, 9 Κ.; in Aulularia sic. ‘haec
scaena anapaestico metro est. Sed concisa sunt, ut non intellegas!

rence and of limited use. A single Bacchiae Tetrameter, for instance,
