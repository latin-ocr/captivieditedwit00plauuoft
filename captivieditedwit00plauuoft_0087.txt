or thus, with the abnormal dice‘re in its proper place (Tetram. and Trim.) z

A. Quid cum ea negoti tibist? B. Peccaui: sslud
dicere uilicum uolebam.

What we call Synaphea of lines, i.e. the elision of a vowel at the end of one
⁴ line ' before the initial vowel of the next, is of course another feature that will
vary according to the way in which we choose to print the cola or lines of a
‘system’ It appears, for example, in this distribution of the Anapaests in
Aul. 724 (they may also be written as one long line) :

sedulo? egomet me defraudaufi)
animumque meum geniumque meum,

of the Cretics in Epid. 173—4 (the distribution in the Ambrosian Palimpsest) ε

Α. Reuereor filium. B. At pol ego te credidfi)
uxorem, quam tu extulisti, pudore exsequi.

6. The dialogue-metres of the Latin Dramatists do not compare
(as metres) very unfavourably with their Greek originals in the few
cases in which the latter have been preserved. Take for example the
opening lines of Ennius' &ledea Ewul and Euripides' Medea:

Utinam ne in nemore Pelio securibus

caesa accidisset abiegna ad terram trabes,

neue inde nauis incohandi exordium

coepisset, quae nunc nominatur nomine

Argo, quia Argiui in ea delecti uiri

uecti petebant pellem inauratam arietis

Colchis, imperio regis Peliae, per dolum.

nam numquam era errans mea domo ecferret pedem
Medea, animo aegra, amore saeuo saucia.

εἷθ’ ὤφελ’ Ἀργοῦς μὴ διαπτάσθαι σκάφος
Κόλχων ἐς αἶαν κυανέας Ξυμπληγάδας,
μηδ’ ἐν νάπαισι Πηλίου πεσεῖν ποτε
τμηθεῖσα πεύκη, μηδ’ ἐρετμῶσαι χέρας
ἀνδρῶν ἀριστέων, οἳ τὸ πάγχρυσον δέρας
Πελίᾳ μετῆλθον. οὐ γὰρ ἂν δέσποιν’ ἐμὴ
Μήδεια πύργους γῆς ἔπλευσ’ Ἰωλκίας,

ἔρωτι θυμὸν ἐκπλαγεῖσ’ Ἰάσονος.

It must not be supposed that the Latin Iambics and Trochaics
are quite inartistic reproductions. In some respects the Roman
writers follow stricter laws of composition than the Greek. They
are more particular with regard to Caesura. While Iambic Trimeters
without Caesura are frequent in Aristophanes', they are rare in

¹ The poets of the New Comedy are more cat-esu] in the matter of Caesura
than Aristophanes (see Perschinka, Dissert. Philol. Vindob. iii. p. 366).
