50 INTRODUCTION.

division of syllables between words as exhibits the metrical form
υ υ, - (111. ξ 7). But we find examples even in the dialogue metres
when the initial syllable of the following word is short, eg.

Poen. 988 pro di inmortales, pharim} ad illunc modum (cf. ΑΡ),
Poen. 176 30 amare uelle atque obsequi animo suo (P, A n. L).

(For other examples see Klotz, Grundzu'qe, p. 133. Many editors
disallow this Hiatus.)

Of other than Cretic words we find, eg. :

Cas. 258 cui homin? hodie peculi nummus non est plumbeus (P, A η. L).
Most. 259 una opert? ebur atramento candefacere postules (P, Α n. l.).

(Other examples in Klotz, ibid.) The principle which determines the 01131011
and non-elision of these final syllables in Plautus has not yet been detected.
It was probably some secondary sentence-accent, which, in the obscurity that
covers the whole of Latin sentence-accentuation (see Appendix), still remains
beyond our ken. It is noticeable that in (Ias. 157 (Cretic) :

faciam uti proinde ut est dignus uitam colat (ΑΡ),

Plautus changes ut to uti, presumably 10 avoid the hiatus facidm'ut.
The abnormal hiatus in Ennius' epitaph (of unknown authorship and date):

aspicite, O cives, senis Eun} imaginis formam (i) Ennii),

is quite isolated (cf. Enn. A. 588 Μ.). The rule is that in other than monosyllabic
words the long syllable shortened in hiatus must be preceded by another short
syllable, which along with the shortened syllable forms a resolved arsis or thesis.

41. But we also find monosyllables in Prosodic Hiatus that are
equivalent to 0110 ‘moras They can sometimes be referred to word-
groups, eg. detlwrdeo in Asin. 706 (like dehortor, eg. Pocn. 674),
quamobrem in Amph. 552, tametsi in Pseud. 244 :

demam hercle iam de hordeo tolutim ni badizas (P, Nonius) 3

Scelestissimum te arbitror. Nam quam 6b rem (P, Α ἰἰ. ἰ.)’ἒ

redi ct respice ad nos, tametsi occupatu’s (P, A η. l.) 3
but usually, perhaps always, they are better explained from the
avoidancc of the total suppression of a word by Elision, just as in
the Greek Dramatists we find words like τί left unelided. Thus
we have crim hac czZm istac Cas. 612 (A P) 3 Most. 392 czZm hac, czZm
istac ( P, A η. L).

Another example is:

Poen. 1054 Νᾶτη, haud repudio hospitium neque Carthaginem (ΑΡ).

(Cf. Skutsch in Berl. Phnilfol. 11701·Ιιιηικσῖινιζίῖ, Jan. 27, 1894.)

The extent to which the Dramatists permit the total 01131011 of monosyllabic
words has not yct been properly iiivcstigated. (Cf. Maurenbrecher Hiatus,
pp. 153 sqq.) Pediaski (Troch. Sept. Terent. p. 10) denies the statement that
Terence never begins Trochaic lines with a wholly elided monosyllable. Seyffert
