62 INTRODUCTION.

A. Ῐ hac: te sequor. B. Quin uocas spectatores si-

but in the ‘Palatine' recension as a Bacchiae Trimeter Oatalectic
followed by a long Cretic series :

A. Quid nunc? numquid iratus es

Alit mihi aut filio propter has res, Simo?

B. Nil profecto. A. Ϊ hac: te sequor. B. Quin uocas
Spectatores simul? A. Hercle me isti hau solent. ’

(Of. ξ 33; and for fuller details of the ‘Ambrosian' and ‘ Palatine'
Colometry, Studemund, de Cantici& Plautinis. Berlin, 1864.) Un-
fortunately the original Colonietry of the ‘Palatine⁷ recension has
been to a great extent obscured in the extant representatives of the
‘Palatine' family, owing to the scribe of their immediate original
(P) having combined two or more short lines into one long line, and
in various ways having departed from the colometry of the proto-
archetype for the sake of saving spacel. Where we have not the
testimony of the Ambrosian Palimpsest we are often left in great
uncertainty regarding the proper arrangement of a Canticum. The
discussion whether Plautus used this or that peculiar length of line,
i.e. the Bacchiac Trimeter‚ is scarcely profitable, since, in the first
place, in a large number of Cantica we cannot be sure of Plautus'
own distribution of the lines, and in the second, where there is a
‘system’ or continuous run of a particular metre, the division of this
‘system' into lines is usually a mere matter of caprice.

The Anapaestic ‘system’ Pseud. 1315 sqq.‚ was written in the ‘Ambrosiam’
recension in Tetrameters, in the ‘Palatine' as Dimeters; and most cases of
divergence in the ‘Ambrosiam' and ‘ Palatine’ Colometry are merely equivalent
methods of writing down a metrica] ‘ system.' The curicus ‘ clausulae‚’ which
are a feature of the Colometry of the Ambrosian Palimpsest, seem to indicate a
metrica] ‘system’: e.g. Cas. 673, a bacchiac passage, written in A:

A. Quid cum ea
negoti tibist? B. Peccaui:

illud dicere uilicum uolebam,
might be printed thus:

A. Quid cum ea negoti tibist? B. Peccaui: illud dicere uilicum uolebam,

as seven Bacchii (the sixth defective, ξ 33), or thus (Trim. and Teutam.) :

A. Quid cum ea negoti tibist? B. Ρ66-
-caui: illud dicere uilicum uolebam,

¹ We infer the Colometry of PA ε
(1) from T, (2) from the occasional retention in P (i.e. BCD) of capital

letters as the initials of words which in ΡΑ began the line, (3) from a sifting of
the evidence afforded by the actual division of the lines in P.
