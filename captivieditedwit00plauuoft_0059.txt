25. But there is one case of shortening which does not quite
seem to conform with the conditions mentioned above (ξ 23).
I mean the shortening of the final syllable of Cretic words and
word-endings, a shortening of which we find traces even in Horace,
eg. Polli& (C. ii. 1. 14), dim-5 (S. i. 4. 104) (see above ἕ 18), and
in all poets in the word nescioquis Here we have the one condition
observed, viz. that a short syllable shall precede the shortened
syllable, but apparently not the other, viz. that the accent which
operates in the shortening shall fall on the neighbouring syllable.
The accent which operates in the shortening of the final syllable of
Polli& is apparently the accent on the syllable Pol.. It may indeed be
said that in a phrase like cliwero uerbum the accent 011 13116 syllable
ver-, the neighbouring syllable in the word-group dioeev'o-ubrbum, is the
operating faetor. But it is questionable whether the Oretic words
which exhibit this reduction in Plautus are so definitely member-S of
word-groups as the Iambic words which exhibit 113, eg. dabo (dabb-
plciqam, &c 3 above, ξ 19). Perhaps it is truer to regard as a factor
in the shortening the tendency of every final syllable in Latin to be
weakly articulated, and the tendency of a final vowel to be shortened
before an initial vowel (ξ 38). In Plautus a shortening of this kind in
Iambic and Trochaic verse 0611 106 looked for only in the first foot of
the line or hemistich, since a collocation of syllables like —‘— υ υ, —‘ is
excluded (iii. ξ 7). Instances in these metres are not frequent,
eg. Rucl. 944 Α. Enicas iam me odio, quisquis es. B. Non sinam
ego abire hinc te. Mane3 Cape. 408 Nfinquam erit tam auarus quin
te ΙΙ qrdciis emittat manu. (Siniilarly sequimini is a proceleusmatic
in (Ias. 165 Sequimini: fortasse te illum mirari coquum.) But they
abeund in Anapaestic lines, eg. mucias Trin. 821, turbines Trin. 835,
maritumis Cist. 211, Cas. 165 Sequimini comites in proxumum me
huc, «110. (For a fuller list see Klotz, Grundzz'c'qe, p. 59.) And this
is apparently the true scansion in Anapaestic Cantica of words
formerly scanned with Synizesis, eg. yctuclio, aureo (g 15).

N5n-enim is always a dactyl. never a cretio, in dialogue metres. Of. Ennius
