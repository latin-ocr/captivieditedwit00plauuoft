APPENDIX. 371

and of the ordinary group, Trin. 79:
suspicionem et culpam ut ab se segreget,

where ab se is written in the best Palatine MS. apsa, as it would probably
be pronounced. A disyllabic Preposition was accented on the final syllable
before an enclitic Pronoun‚ an accentuation very faithfully reflected by the
incidence of ictus in Plautus' lines, eg.

Trin. 619 ulciscare et mshi ut erya‘ te fui et sum, referas gratiam.
ib. 733 sine dote, quom eius rem pene‘s me habeam domi.
Stich. 415 et is hodie apz‘cd me cenat et frater meus.

Before a Noun on the other hand apud is quite differently treated. In the
phrase apud forum, for example, Plautus scans apfcd forum, and this word-
group shews the same incidence of ictus as a four—syllabled word of this
(Fourth Paeon) form (ξ 1), (ipzld-forum (Intr. ii. 19).

21. The strong stress of Interrogative‚ and the weak stress of Relative
and Indefinite Pronouns, is reflected in the versification of Plautus and
Terence in their treatment of such a word as unde. If we examine the
instances of uncle Relative and uncle Interrogative in their playsl, we see
that in the great majority the Relative stands in thesi and the Interrogative
in arsi. Similarly quis Interrogative, a word which naturally stands at
the beginning of a sentence or line, will be found in this position far oftenel
in Trochaic lines, where the ictus falls on the first syllable, than in Iambic,
where the ictus falls on the second syllable of the line. The predominant
stress of the Interrogative in the phrase quis laic homost .?‚ ‘who's this2’
is echoed by its normal ictus quis laic lwmost?(Seyfl'ert‚ Berl. Phil. Woclz.
1891, p. 108). Similarly the normal incidence of ictus in quid ita ?‚ quid
aqi-s ?‚ quid ιῐϊε (Skutsch in Berl. Phil. W och. 1892, p. 1615) seems to reflect
the pronunciation quid-ita ?‚ quid-ayis .?‚ quid-MS? A good example of the
treatment of Interrogatives is Asin. 258:

Unde sumam? quem interum-tam? qud hanc celocem conferam?

It may be added that quidum? takes normally the ictus on the first
syllable (instances in Richardson, de ‘dam’ particula, p. 14), and similarly
quid ἔεί quod...?, quid istac &st quod...?, quid hae est quod... seem to
be normal (examples in Dittmar, »Studien zur lateinischen Moduslekre,
pp. 11 sqq.) The hypothetica] accentuation of the postposited Relaffive,
as in Troiae qui primus, &c. is reflected by the common incidence of ictus
in such cases in Plautus and Terence (unless the prefixed word is specially
emphasized), e.g.

Haut. prol. 43 nam m'inc nomi-3 qui scribunt nil parcunt seni,

Hec. prol. 12 nouds qui exactas fcci ut inueterascerent.
