exhibit a reconciliation of natural accent and metrica] ictus which
is gained by the sacrifice of the Greek requirement of frequent
Diaeresis. This Latin type (called ‘ dactylic' by Marius Victorinus)
would be the product of a long experience‚ just 68 1116 adaptation of
the Greek Elegiae (see Appendix) was the work of successive genera-
tions of poets. Pioneers‚ like Plautus, in the adaptation of the Greek
metres to Latin poetry, would not readily hit upon the proper device
for turning out smooth lines. And so it is in his Anapaestic Metres
that we find the most marked discrepancy between natural accent
and metrical ictus in the poetry of Plautus. It seems difficult to
believe that the same poet, who in other metres so successfully
reconciles accent with ictus, should tolerate lines like :

Prin. 239 blandiloquentxilus, harpago, mendax,
Bacch. 1088 stulti, stolidi, fatui, fungi, Η bardi, blenni, bucc6nes,
Pers. 753 hostibus uictis, ciuibiis saluis, etc.

And yet we must remember that the Greek requirements of the
metre, viz. diaeresis usually at the end of the ‘metrum' and always
at the end of the 1161111811611, were requirements which necessitated
in any Latin line constructed on this pattern a constant discrepancy
between ictus and accent. Lines like these of Anaxandrides (frag.

xli. 39 sqq. K.):

πουλύποδείων, χολίκων, δημοῦ,

φυσκῶν, ζωμοῦ, τευτλῶν, θριῶν,

θυννίδες ὀπταί, φυκίδες ἑφθαί,
could not be exactly reproduced except by lines like the above. No
doubt a good many verses (eg. Τνιῖη, 2392> have been referred to
Anapaestic Metre in Plautus which really belong 10 011161 metres (eg.

by a tendency to call them al] Anapaestic. Still it remains an
undoubted fact that a large number of passages, unmistakeably
Anapaestic, shew the most pronounced disi-egard of the word· and
sentence-accent. Inferences with respect to the accentuation of
Latin words cannot therefore be safely made from Anapaestic lines,
except in the case of the Law of Breves Breviantes (ii. g 23). That 1116
