288—290] Aer. 11. 66. 11. 195

Nam 11110 quidem Theodoromedes fuit germano nomine.—

ΗΕΘ. Quid tu ais? Tenaxne pater est eius? PHIL.
Immo edepol pertenax;

The word here refers to the third member of the compmmd name, viz.
thensauo·0clmysom·co-‚ ‘conqueror of treasures of gold,⁷ and should not be
explained as the equivalent of avaritia on the strength of Paul. F est. 15.
20 Th. Audacia ab avide, id est cupide, ayendo est dicta. Paulus is rather
accounting for the etymology from avidus than communicating from early
literature an obsolete sense of the Noun.

288. Hegio does not know the real name till v. 635, so that this
remark of Philocrates must be an ‘aside' to the audience, uttered, we
may suppose, while Hegio, reflecting on this new piece of informatxom
takes a step away from him. We have no reason to suppose that stage-
directions like our ‘asida' were entered in ancient editions of Plautus.
The few traces that we find in our MSS„ eg. Aul. 60 “ laec secwm loquiturss'
may have been added in mediaeval times. ’ Illic (Adv.) quidem can
hardly be a scribe's corruption of ille quidem (the reading substituted by
Luchs), for a scribe would not change a familiar to an unfamiliar form,
though it may be of illi (Adv.) quidem (of. ad v. 60). Illic quidem seems
not to 066111· 111 Plautus, but only ille quidem (eg. v. 573).

289. Quid tu ais ⁸? (referring to V. 257). See note on v. 990. Per-
tenax. Compounds with per in its intensive sense were ‘Separable'
Compounds (cf. per pol saepe peccas Cas. 370>3 and the vowel of the simple
stem did not suffer weakening, so that pertenent* is a preferable spelling to
pertinax. Lucilius twitted Scipio Africanus Minor with his affected use of
penisus instead of pertaesus (inc. 169 Μ.);

Quo facetior uideare, 61, scire plus quam ceteri,
‘Pertisum’ hominem, non pertaesum, dices.

Pertaesum is the spelling on the Lyons tablet of the Emperor Claudius,
a purist in these matters.

2901 Ut magis. See note on ut fimilius v. 33. Ubi quando.
Quando seems here to be indefinite, ‘at any ti1ne,' as in se'qzcando (eg. Cato
R. R. 151. 4, 157. 10). Cf. Stich. 201 Ec· quando (laem auctionem factarum
sciunt, Adeunt, perquirunt quid siet causae ilico.
