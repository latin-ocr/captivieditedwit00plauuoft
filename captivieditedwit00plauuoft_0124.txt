98 INTRODUCTION.

(cf. v. 251 RK, Pouet. 4 R), and in the Antiyo‘na of Accius
(140—-1 R.):

heus, uigiles, properate, expergite
pectora tarda sopore, exsurgite!

Some would reokon as Daetylic all Anapaestic passages in which dactyls
shew a majority, eg. Trin. 239 ε

blandiloquentuffls, harpago, mendax,

and there is a temptation to ascribe intermixture of Dactylics and Anapaestios
(in the manner of Cretios and Baechiacs,§ 34) to passages like Pseud. 595—
601, Trin. 1v. i.

J. Ionio.

48. Of the two varieties of Ionio foot, the Ionio ‘a maJ'ore'
(ss -'- ψ ψ), and Ionio ‘a minore’ (υ υ 4 4), the latter is best known
to us in Latin poetry from Horaee's ode (Ο. 111. xii.) beginning:

Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci
mala uino lauere aut exanimari metuentes
patruae uerbera linguae 5

of the former the most familiar variety is the Sotadie Verse, which
exhibits that modification of one or more feet which is teehnioally
known as ‘ anaclasis' (-' o —‘- υ instead of ss —'- o o), and ends the line
with -Ξ, Of this Sotadie Verse we have an example, the earliest
known in Latin literature¹‚ in the Amphitruo, VV. 168 sqq. (the
‘anaclastic' feet are indicated by Italics):

noctesque diiesque assidulo satis sulperque est

quod facto aut Ι dicto adeost Ι opas quietas Ι 110 sis.
ipse dominus Ι diues opelria [et] laboris Ι expers, 170
quodcumque homiffm' accidit ΖὶΙόἒνέ, posse Ι retur:
aequom esse pultat, non repultat ζώω-’ἵε Ι quid sit.

Here we have examples of various substitutes allowed for the
pure Ionio foot‚ viz. the Choriambus (—o υ -) 111 ν. 169 dicto adeost,
the Molossus (— — —) in v. 169 quodfacto (auc, and of the forms with
resolution of long arsis, we have in v. 170 υυυυυ ipse dominus,

1 If it is older than 11110 Sota of Ennius, of which one or two lines have
been preserved, eg. 65 M.:

ille ictu’ re'tro reccidIt Ι ivl uatem sulpinus.

A line preserved from the Inimici of Afranius gives us another example of
the Ionio a Majore or Versus Sotadeus without ‘anaclasis’ (202 R.):

multa atque mollesta es: potin Ι ut dieta falcessas?
