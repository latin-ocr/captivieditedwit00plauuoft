111. METRE. 91

(ii. ξ 37) and Syllaba Anceps (e.g. v. 233) 616 allowed at the
Diaeresis.

For fuller details regarding the Diaeresis of the Cretic Tetrameter, see Klotz,
Grundziiye, pp. 220 sqq. He shews that it is dispensed with when a long word
could not otherwise be brought into the line, e.g. Pseud. 1303 ι

Massici montis uberrumos quattuor.
Terence has a passage in Cretic Tetrameters in the Andria (vv. 626 sqq).

The Trimeter is rare It 0661115, e.g. in Pseud. 1119, 61 1116 end of a Tetra-
meter passage :

uerum ubi is 11011 1161111 nec uocat.

(Cf. Cas. 150.) The Dimeter is not so rare, e.g. Pseud. 1108 stiruitutis ferunt.
In the Persa, if we follow the arrangement of the Ambrosian Palimpsest, we
have a Dimeter with two Monometers, at vv. 17 sqq. :

1 Α. tlt uales?
B. Ut queo. A. Quid agitur?
B. Viuitur;

and in the Epidicus pairs of Monometers (written by some editors as Dimeters)
alternating with Trochaic Septenarii at vv. 85 sqq. z

Neque ego nunc
quomodo
me expeditum ex impedito faciam, consilium placet.
ego miser
perpuli
meis dolis senem, sit censeret suam sese emere filiam:

fidicinam emit, qufim Ipse amat, quam 61116115 mandauit mihi, 816.

Β111 1116 recognition of these varieties is generally more or less arbitrary, for
they depend on the method followed in breaking up a ‘ system' into its separate
lines (01· rather ‘cola’) (see ξ 5). The same is true of 1116 ‘hypermetric' Cretic
Verse which appears now and then in conjunction with Bacchiacs, e.g. Men. 573,
Ε11111115 Tray. 305 R. (quoted in ξ 33). Other lines sometimes scanned as
‘hypermetric’ Cretics may be regarded as Cretics with a Trochaic colon, e.g.
Capt. 215 sed breuem orricion(em) ΙΙ incipisse (cf. Leo, Plaut. Cant. pp. 17 sq.).

38. A common type is the ‘contracted' or defective Tetra-
meter in which the second arsis of the third foot is wanting
(cf. the ‘contracted' Bacchiae, ἶς’ 33), e.g. Most. 691 :

nec quod una 6566 1116 iuuerit magis.

The thesis of the ‘contracted ’ foot is usually ‘ pure' (i.e. a. short syllable) ;
but cf. Most. 108 tempestas uenit.

A not infrequent variety departs from this in much the same
way as the ‘miuric' variety (ending — υ υ ψ Ξ) from the ordinary
