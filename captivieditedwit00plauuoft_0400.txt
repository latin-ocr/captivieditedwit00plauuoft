phrase ‘to make a noise,’ so the Latin verb in such phrases would seem to
have been subordinate, and this subordination or enclisis would imply in
Latin its fusion with the noun into a word-compleX‚ operam—dabam (cf. pes-
sum—do, vernam-do). We cannot then find a oonfiict of accent and ictus in
such phrases from Terence as:

Ad. 473 fidem-dans, iurans se illam ducturum domum,

Pkorm. 492 Nondum mihi credis? Hariolare. Sin fidem-do?
Fabulae Ξ ,

Andr. 243 itane obstinate operam-dat ut me a Glycerio miserum
abstrahat 2

19. Among Subordinate Nouns like our ‘thingss ‘kind‚’ ‘part’ in such
phrases as ‘something of that kind,⁷ ‘some parts of England' we may
reckon in Latin res (eg. quare, quam6brem), ‘modus (eg. qudmodo, quemad-
modum), locus in the adverbia] word-groups ubi-loci .?, interea—loci, &c.
Donatus in his note on Ter. Eun. 255 (11. ii. 24):

dum haec loquimur, interes? loci ad macellum ubi aduenffimus,

tells us that interea-loci formed a word-group with aceent on α, the last
syllable of interea and the antepenultimate of the word-group. In Plautus

we have already seen the subordination of res in the phrase ἒῖ ME) operam
dabam invariably echoed by the incidence of ictus on the Pronoun. Mala
res, the equivalent of mahen, ‘punishmentss ‘evil in st0re‚' seems to be a
word-group with metrical ictus corresponding to the accentuation mala-res,

malae-rei, malam-rem, mala-re, eg. Trz'n. 1045:
hercle istis malam rem magnam moribus dignumst dari.

Similarly bonus vir shows normally the ictus bonus-vir (final s usually did
not produce length by ‘position' in the time of Plautus), bone-vir, &c.
The same subordination of vio* is seen in the common phrase scelzis viri
‘the wretch,' which exhibits the normal ictus of a Fourth Paeon word,
seem-viri. The phrase nemo laomo (a curious indication of the early date
of the reduction of ηε-Ιιεηηο) takes the ictus always on the first syllable,
ne'm(o)-l20mo (Seyffert in Bursian's Jahresbeo-z'clzt, 1894, p. 329).

20. Prepositions were fused with a following Noun into a compound
word and would be entirely without stress in a group like acl-camum, as in
a compound Verb like ccccmo, but before an enclitic or unemphatic Pro-
noun they would doubtless take an accent, ‹id-me, (id-eum, like Greek πρός
με, Engl. ‘to hi1n‚’ ‘for him‚' Early Irish for-m ‘on me,' for-t ‘on thee.’
This treatment of the Preposition before an unemphatic Pronoun is
reflected in every page of Plautus and Terence, who hardly ever relegate
it to the thesis unless the Pronoun is elided, eg. acl-m(e) adveni-53 and it
is likely enough that the elision of the Pronoun restored the Preposition in
actual pronunciation to its unaecented state. A good example of the
treatment of the group when the Pronoun has emphasis is seen in
