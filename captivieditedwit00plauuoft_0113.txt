111. METRE. 87

B. Nemo audet prope accedere. A. F'lxoret. B. Orat:
negat ponere alio modo fillo profecto,
nisi se sciat uilieo non datum iri.
A. Atque ingratiis, quia non uolt, nubet hodie. 700
nam quor non ego id perpetrem quod coepi,
ut nubat mihi? illud quidem uolebam,

v. 703.
A. Timor praepedit u(erba‚ uiirum, obsecro te,
dic med uxorem orare ut exoret illam. 705

The eontracted lines break the monotony of the passage in much the same
fashion as the introduction of syneopated Iambie or Trochaic ‘metra' in an
Iambic or Trochaie passage of a Greek chorus. But while in these Greek
passages this syncope may appear at any part of the line, the ‘contracted’
Bacchius (usually an Iambus or Tribrach) is limited to one position.

These ‘eontracted' Tetrameters were formerly regarded as corrupt by
editors, who exer-ted themselves to transform them into normal lines. Thus
in the above passage of the Casina Schoell prints v. 685 with insertion of

quam. adagque miser. Β. ludo ego hune quam facete,

v. 694 with insertion of hominum ε
occisissirnus sum omnium hominum qui uiuont,

v. 695 with insertion of hoc and transposition of mi and optumum:
loricam induam: hoc optumum mi esse opinor,

in spite of the ‘consensus‘ of the Ambrosian Palimpsest and the Palatine MSS.
The metre is otherwise explained by those who regard ‘hypercatalectic’ Iambic
lines as a legitimate variety for Plautus (see ἕ 6). They make it a combination
of a Bacchiae Dimeter acatalectic (eg. occisis-simas snm 0m-) with an Iambic
Monometer ‘hypercatalectie’ (azizim qui τιῐΙιιοηῑ).

In the Canticum in the Andria (Aet1v. Sc. i.) a Cretie passage is followed
first by an Iambic couplet, then by a Bacchiae couplet (vv. 637—8).

The option often presents itself of treating a passage either as a Bacchiae
(or Cretic) ‘system’ throughout, or else as Bacchiae in part and Cretic in part.
Pseud. 1329—30 received the one colometry in the ‘Palatine,' the other in the
‘Ambrosian’ recension (see ξ 5). Cf. Pseud. 1126 sqq.; Men. 571 sqq.; Caecilius
151 sqq. R. (quoted in ἓ 2). Α fragment of the Thyestes of Ennius, quoted by
Cicero (Tusc. 111. xii. 26> seems to be of this nature (303 sqq. R.):

Nolite, hospites, ad me adire: ilico isti:
ne contagio mea bonis umbraue obsit.
tanta uis sceleris in corpore haeret.
Quidnam est, obsecro? quid te adir(i) abnutas?

34. Baechiaes are often found in conjunction with Cretica
Thus the Canticum in Act Ι. Sc. V. of the Rudens begins with a
Bacchiae passage of 6 lines (vv. 259-264), followed almost immedi-
ately by a Cretic passage of 12 lines (vv. 266—277), at the close of
which the Bacchiae metre is resumed (vv. 278 sqq.) ; cf. Act 1. Sc. ii.
of the Mostellaria. (Cf. the change from Iambic to Troehaic metre,

313.)
