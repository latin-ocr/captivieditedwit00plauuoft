is surely unreasonable. The scansion of a Latin line was determined
by the Latin pronunciation of a sentence, not by a music-conductor’s
indication of the ‘ time '. This theory that the shortening of syllables
through the Breves Breviantes Law was due to ictus has led many
of its supporters to the strange idea that Plautus allowed a Trochaic
Septenarius (Stich. 700, quoted in Ξ 17) to begin with the word
amica, scanned as a tribrach. The incidence of the ictus on the first
syllable of the line, they say, caused the word to sound (in this
particular line) amica instead of amica. But if (as they allow) the
word was invariably pronounced comica by a Roman, how could the
mere wielding of a conductor's baton legitimize a mispronunciation
like amicast} This extreme form of the theory, which seems hardly
worth discussing, has been already noticed in Ξ 17, Here we have to
consider a more plausible hypothesis, which ascribes to the ictus a
negative, rather than a positive, voice in the scansion of a line.
In the case of certain syllables which in ordinary pronunciation were
deprived of their full ‘long’ quantity and on occasion assumed or
came near to assuming the ‘ short' quantity, the ictus of the line, it
is supposed, might interfere to prevent the syllable from playing this
assumed part. The words ubi male accipiar were so pronounced
by Roman lips that the true iambic sound of uhi was obscured and
the word fell on the ear almost like a pyrrich. A poet had thus the
option of treating the word as a pyrrich, when it pleased him to do
so, instead of as an iambus. According to this hypothesis, he would
abstain from availing himself of this licence in certain circumstances.
He would, for example, have no hesitation in beginning a trochaic
line with the tribrach 2in meib, but would avoid, as inharmonious,
the same tribrach—opening of an iambic line ιῖόΐ ηιᾰί-.

Even this modified form of the theory seems to mc to ascribe a potency to
the ictus in Latin verse which it could only have in the sing-song repetition of
Roman school-children. Plautus scanned thu words ubi male accipiar as he
pronounced them. If his pronunciation of ubi in this context varied on occasion
between ubi and ubi, or was consistently half-way between the two scansions, he
admitted the one or the other according to inetrical exigencies. In this case the
metre toleratos both ubi and ubi, and the only consideration that would deter-
mine his metrical treatment of the word would be his notorious predilection for
611 identity of ictus and accent (see Appendix). If we ean prove that the rhythm
ubi male accipiar more exactly reproduced the intonation of these words in
ordinary discourse than ubi mala accipiar, then we have all the justification we
need for believing the first foot of the line to be 6 tribrach. The dialogue
metres usually leave us without definite indication of the quantity in such
cases; and we cannot appeal to the other metres used by Plautus, for in
