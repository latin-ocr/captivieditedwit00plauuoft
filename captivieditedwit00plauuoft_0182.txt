154· PLAVTI OAPTIVI. [127—130

Visam ne nocte hac quippiam turbauerint.
Inde me continuo recipiam rursum domum.

Propter sui gnati miseriam miserum senem. 130

was probably not seen on the stage, for, if it had been, we should have
expected some indication by the use of a Demonstrative Pronoun or Adverb.
Ad fratrem ad...captiuos <see note on v. 175).

127. (Ibo)...Visam. This Asyndeton is normal with eo and uiso,
eg. Pers. 77 Nunc liuc iutro ibo, uisam hesternas reliqu-ias, Quierintue recte
necne (cf. Bacch.. 235). But ibo ut uisam occurs in Aul. 65 Nunc ibo ut
uisam sitne ita aurum ut coozdz'da' (cf. Bacch. 529). Nocte hac,
with a Perfect Tense means ‘last night' (eg. Amph. 731 qui liae noctu
in portum aduecti sumus), but otherwise ‘to-night' (eg. Triu. 869 hac
noctu amicandum& uigilias). Quippiam. The archetype of our MSS.
had quipiam, which might be Abl. or rather lnstrumental (note on v. 88)
of quispiam, as aliqui (Truc. 922 qaudere aliqui me uolo) of aliquis. Since
however the ordinary construction of turbo is with Acc. Neut. (eg. Most.
1031 numquid Tranio turbauit ἒ), and since the existence of the form
quipiam lacks certainty, it is perhaps safer to regard quipiam as a mere
misspelling. Indeed the analogy of Juppiter <with short u and double pp),
the accepted spelling of Jzi-pzsster (with long u and single p), suggests that
by a Latin phonetical law qui-piam, if such a form ever existed, would
have become quippiam. Quippe, the Conjuiiction, may have been originally
qui-pe.

128. Inde me, pronounced iud' me (Introd. ii. ξ 8).

129. As Hegio turns to go away, Ergasilus, to attract his attention,
utters aloud some sympathetic remarks, of which v, 132 is probably ‘aside'
to the audience. His gradual attraction of Hegio's compassion towards
his own dinncrless condition is very cleverly managed. Aegre est
mi, with Acc. and Inf. (cf. v. 701). The opposite was uolup est mi. Cf.
Mil. 747 si illis (zeqqrest milii id quod volup est.

130. Propter sui gnati miseriam probably goes with faeere quaestum
carcerarium (cf. v. 98 Nunc liic occepit quaestum huuc fili qratia), rather
than with miserum (cf. liud. 127 Propter eimmodi uiros uiuo miser).
J ingling phrases with miser, miseria, misera, &a arc common in Plautus,
eg. Epz‘d. 526 Siquid est laomim? 77227.s·e1·z'a2·zmz quod miserescat, miser ew
animost, Tmo. 466 ea illi miserae miseriam (of. Amph. 590, A ul. 721, Uist.
689, Epid. 667, Men. 817, Pers. 646, lead. 216, Trin. 430).
