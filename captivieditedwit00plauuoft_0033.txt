1. THE MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUs. 11

in what seem to be errors of text, the theory has been formulated that
A and PA were closely connected, both coming from one and the same
original (not necessarily an immediate original) which had its margins
supplied with variants, and that the points of difference between A
and PA are due to the scribes of the two MSS. having selected their
text now from the margin, and now from the text of this common
original. (See Leo, Plaut. Forsclmmqen, chap. i.) Some theorists have
even gone so far as to specify the number of lines on each page of
this supposed original with the help of seeming lacunae in A and ΡΑ.
And yet, if we consider how numerous must have been the copies of
Plautus in the Empire, especially after the study of the old Republican
writers became the fashion, it is scarcely credible that our two MSS„
the one apparently Italian, the other probably F rench, should be so
closely related. The whole tenor of recent Plautine study has shewn
that what seemed at first sight to be errors common to A and PA
have usually turned out to be genuine readings, and that the safest
rule for an editor is to accept any reading supported by both A and ΡΑ,
unless there is clear possibility of the scribe of A and some scribe of
a Palatine archetype, whether of PA or P or PBD, dcc„ having fallen
separately into the same mistake. There may be a few scribal
errors which were present in some very early edition of Plautus, and
which have found their way by direct transmission into both A and
ΡΑ, but they are unlikely to be much more numerous than the mis-
prints repeated for some generations in editions, let us say, of
Shakespeare or Milton. A study of the divergent readings of A
and PA leaves the impression rather of two different editions which
had in many passages been assimilated through the adoption by one
of some readings of the other, than of two copies of the same edition
which were beginning to exhibit points of dissimilarity‘.

¹ A list of divergent readings of A and PA will bc found in Niemeyer, de
Plauti fabularum recensione duplici, Berlin, 1377 (cf. Baier‚ de Plautifabularum
recensionibus Ambrosiana ct Palatina, Bresiau, 1585). - The list is capable of
improvement. Some readings are attributed to ΡΑ, which the evidence of T shews
to be mere errors of P; some readings assigned to A will be struck out after refer-
ence to Studemund’s Apograph. The aim of both treatises is to decide whether A
or PA is the better authority for the text os Plautus. It is now generally admitted
that both MSS. had their strong and wcak points, and that each reading must bc
judged on its own merits. The passages quoted by Nonius from Plautus have
been collected by Caesar, de Plauti memoria apud Nonium seruata, in vol. xi. of
the Dissertationes Philoloyicae Araenloratenses, Strassburg, 1894. Here too thc
readings must be tested by a reference to Onions’ edition of Nonius i.—iii.
(Oxford 1895), and by consideration whether this or that reading is not rather
to be regarded as a mistake of a mediaeval scribe than as the actual text of

Nonius For the Plautine passages quoted by Festus, see Leidolph‚ de Festi et
Pauli locis Plautinis, Jena, 1883.
