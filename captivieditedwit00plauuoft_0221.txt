280. The line cannot remain as the MSS. present it, for Aleis as a
third foot is impossible. Schoell's double transposition tanta ez· in Aleis
cum ,qratia deals too violently with the reading of the MSS„ and more
legitimate transpositions like tanta qratia ei cum ivn Aleis or, simpler still,
ei cum tanta in Aleis 9ratia, produce doubtful rhythm. To suppose with
Brix that Aleis, a rare example of the correct form (see note on V. 9), can
have come into the text as a gloss or as a corruption of illis is quite
unreasonable. The explanation that tam, which seems to be capable of
being used by Plautus with a Noun (eg. Per-s. 533), has been ousted by the
gloss or grammatical correction tanta, is the best that has yet been offered,
though it is open to the objection that tam gratia est in Plautus means ‘ no
thank you 1'

281. opimae. The word is used as a synonym of adz'patus by Cicero
Orat. 8. 25 opimum quoddam et tanquam adipatae dictionis glenus. We
cannot but acquiesce in Camerarius' correction of optume (ww) to opimae.
The old spelling optumae (with u) offers a difficulty, seeing that the habit
of mediaeval scribes was rather to modernize the archaic spellings that
they found in their original. We should expect to find optime (ve) in our
MSS. (cf. critical note on v. 769). Ι suppose that the neighbouring Super-
lative with the older spelling (lionommmmm-12 v. 278) suggested the older
form, unless it is due to the similarity of im and um in minuscule (and
other) script. Unde excoquat sebum senex scenis rather a poor
joke. It may be some proverb, the exact sense of which is now lost to us.

282. Quid pater? Viuitne‘? (sce note on v. 717). Abimus is
probably Present, as in Amph. 668 (Ιναῑιίιῖςιυι 090 illanc ln'c reliqui quom
abeo (see note on v. 887).

283. The Verb is often repeated with necne, eg. Epid. 322 sitne quid
necne sit, Scire cupio, but Bacch. 400 sisne necne ut esse oportet. Scilicet
