Nugas, ineptias'.2 incipisse. haereo,
But the scansion -ἴᾶε in— as an Anapaest in an Iambio line is very doubtful
(Introd. iii. ξ 9), though the hiatus at the pause before haereo is legitimate,
as is the change of person (cf. vv. 534—535). Leo alters ineptias, which
he regards as un-Plautine, to ineptus:
Nugas ineptus incipisso. haereo

(nuyas referring to the intended trick of denouncing Aristophontes as a
madman). The non-occurrence of ineptia (used by Terence) elsewhere in
Plautus, except in the prologue to the Μενοαίον (v. 26), is not sufficient
ground for doubting the genuineness of the word, in view of the frequency
of the Adj. ineptus, the Adv. inepte, &03 and ineptus in this line seems to
me unlikely to 108 right. Brix thinks the line should be Cretic. Iambic
metre is more probable, since v. 530 is Ianibic. The least alteration of
the traditional text is the change of ineptias to ineptiam. Ι have also
thought of changing ineptias to fzssneptz'a and z'ncz'pz'sse to incepisse-e, and in
v. 531 maxumas to mammzast, all of then] changes warranted by the clerical
errors of om· Mss. of Plautus (eg. Pers. 491 libertas for libertast). (On the
Verb z'ncz‘pv'sso see note on V. 802.)

Act III. Scene iv. Hegio, accompanied by Aristophontes and
(apparently) by the slaves (see note on v. 551) who have been appointed
to keep watch on Tyndarus, comes out of the house in search of the
captive. Tyndarus, with that jaunty recklessness which we should call
characteristically 12¹2}AE adopts the atrox astutia (V. 538) of pretending to
Hegio that Aristophontes is a dangerous lunatio. We have quite as funny
a scene with the supposed niadman as in the Menaechmi (Act V. Sc. ii—v.),

but the inevitable conclusion comcs at last, the discovery of the plot of the ·

two Captives. This is the longest Scene in the play, but the interest never
flags for a moment3 and we may be sure that the audience would have
welcomed an even longer Scene. The same variation of Trochaic with
Iambic Metre, that we remarked in the last Scene, is kept up at the
beginning of this 0118, until the discovery of Tyndarus (v. 540). All the
rest of the Scene is in Trochaic Septenarii, the common metrical expression
