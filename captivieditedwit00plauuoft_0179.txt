Oaptives were bound together. On sinyularius, class. sinyulamk, see note
on v. 96. Τ11030 catenae are light enough to allow liberty of motion (v. 114),
and they include a collare (V. 357).

113. Istas, ‘which you hold in your hands.⁷ Iuncti. The letters
iu and αἱ are so closely similar in minuscule writing that it is actually not
quite certain whether iuncti or uincti is the reading better supported by
our MSS. The sense requires iuncti (cf. note on V. 112).

114. Sinite. Plautus is so careful in his use of the Fut. Imperative
and Pres. Imper. forms (eg. Mil. 522 loeus, Philocomasium, cito Transcurre
curriculo ad nos, ita neqotiumst. Post, quando exierit Sceledrus a nobis,
cito Traozsourrito ad uos rursum curriculo domum) that we must believe
that there is a notion of futurity in these orders, though it is more patent
in sinito, ‘allow for the future’ (ef. Tria. 485 Semper tu hoc facito, Lesbonz'ce,
coyz'tes), with uolent Fut. in the dependent clause, than in the other F uture
Imperatives indito and demite. The distinction between them and aduorte
is little more than would be expressed by ‘ Look here! I Wish these light
sets of setters to be put on the two prisoners and the heavy set to be taken
off) 11Υο have similarly a further command put in the Fut. Imper., while
the immediate order is in the Pres. Imper., in passages like Asin. 740
Leonida, curre, obsecro: patrem 111ιο orato ut ueniat, Pseud. 20 Cape llas
tabellas: tute hinc narrato tibi, Pseud. 986 Nosce imayinem: tute eius
nomem memorato mihi. The command (cf. v. 125 eura quae iussi) is
apparently carried out with the aid of the assistant {orarii at vv. 195 sqq.
Ambulare, ‘to wall< about‚’ the usual sense (cf. V. 12). Si...si
(Eud. 1257 Si aurum, si amentum est), usually si...sz‘ve in Plautus and
Terence, and sz'vc...sz'vc in Classical Latin. Sz'...sz' was apparently the
oldest form and was used in the religious formula of address to an un-
known god, Si deas, si dea, eg. 0. I. L. i. 632, 1114, Cato R. R. 139 (quoted
below) 810. The metrica] ictus soris ‘in pausa' has nothing objectionable 3
see note on v. 60.

115. Uti, instead of ut, lends impressiveness to the command. Uti
(whether in the sense of ⁴ in order that' 01· of ⁴ as ²) is the form favoured in
Laws (eg. in the S. O. de Bacchanalibus, al. L. 1. 196 of 186 Β.0. Haice
