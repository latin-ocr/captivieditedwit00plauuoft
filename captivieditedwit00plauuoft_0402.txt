372 PLAVTI CAPTIVI.

An example of emphasis on the preceding word is Pseud. 812
boues qui conuiuas faciunt herbasque oggerunt
(in actual talk pronounced Meus-qui) ; cf. Pseud. 860
manum si protollet‚ pariter proferto manum

(actually pronounced mcfmzm-si. The context shews that manum was the
emphatic word of the sentence).

Qui followed by homo seems to make a word-group qui-homo.

22. That the usual position of subordinate Conjunctions like sed, et, ut
is ‘in thesi' is a fact that will be patent to anyone who turns over the pages
of Plautus. In the first 500 lines of——let us say—the Amphitruo an instance
of ut, ‘that‚’ ‘as,' with the ictus can hardly be found, except in phrases
like vit-lubet (V. 396), where it would have the main accent of the word-
group (cf. ραόῑαῦθι, ραῖίαόεῑ), and ‘att-‘videtur (V. 334), where it would have
a secondary accent.

23. Of Word—groups the Grammarians mention some, eg. res-publica,
ius-iurandum, &c., and the Romance languages point to others, e.g. foris-
facere (O. Ital. forfam, Fr. foffaim), ad—z'llam-lcoram (Ital. allora, Fr. alors).
A word-group of Adjective and Noun was apparently *mala crux in the
phrase z· in malam crucem, ‘go and be hanged‚⁷ for the group may be
qualified by an Adjective, ι’ in maxumam ‘tnalam crucem. The accentuation
malam-crucem is reflected by the normal ictus (for details see Luchs in
Studemund's Studien i. pp. 18 sqq.). Other groups of this type are
probably bona-fides, mala-fides, massaum-malum. The last is a common
ending of a line in Plautus, who in Most. 670 admits bonanfide to the same
position, in spite of the law against a diiambic ending (Intr. iii ξ 8). To
the word-groups of N umeral and Noun, like tresviri, vtyinstviri, we may
perhaps add expressions of time like viginti-dies, triginta-dies (cf. our
‘f01·tnight‚' ‘twelvemonth’)‚ or of value, like viqiozti-772iotae‚ triginta—minae
(cf. our ‘sixpence‚² ‘twopence'>. The normal ictus in the Dramatists is
triyintd dies, viyinti minae, &c.‚ although viginti, trzyz‘nta, when not used
in such collocations, show the ictus which we should expect, vz'yinti, trifima
(Skutsch, For-sch. i. 162). On operae—pretium see Bryant in Har-ward
Studies xi.

24. But this theory of Plautus' regard for Acoent, in addition to
Quantity, must not be pushed to an extreme. There is just so much dis-
regard of Accent as to produce what Ritschl happily calls the ‘harmonische
Disharmonie' of Plautine verse. Thus when two words are contrasted
with each other, they have both as a rule the metrical ictus, as they would
in everyday speech have a marked accentuation, e. g. Damas sum non Oedipus,
Ter. Andr. 194, and the absence of this feature often indicates a corruption

in the line. Still the rule is not slavishly followed. Itis sometimes dis-
regarded intentionally, e.g. Trin. 59:

uin cdnmutemus? tuam ego ducam et tu meam 2,
