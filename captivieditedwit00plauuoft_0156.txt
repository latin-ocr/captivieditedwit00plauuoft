no other play of Plautus: V. 168 uam illum confido domum Iu his diebus
me reeouoz'lz'assere, v. 576 Si leuius leuc reconciliasso in libertatem filium.
The simple verb (used in v. 131 Sed εί uZZo pacto ltuo conciliari potest) is
common enough, whether with this (Epist. 654 Et sororem z'u libertatem
idem opera concilio mea) or other meanings. Ut facilius. We have
also quo facilius, eg. Aul. prol. 27 Feci, thensaurum ut hic reperiret Euclio
Quo illam facilius nuptum, si uellet, daret, ib. 33 z‘d ea faciam qratia, Quo
itte eam facilius ducat.

34. Ambos, “emphasized‚ for at first sight there seems no reason why
Hegio should have bought a captive like Tyndarus...Finding that these
two captives were master and slave, and hoping that this fact would
facilitate the exchange, 116 bought them both? Hallidie. De praeda.
Since de praeda emere is the usual Plautino phrase (cf. vv. 111, 453, Epid.
643 in Epict. 621 emi ea· praeda in the Palatine MSS„ but emi de praeda
in the Ambrosian Palimpsest), one hesitates to follow editors in changing
de to e, especially as the reading is corroborated by v. 111. 011 the other
hand lto-sce is the form used before an initia] vowel, not an initia] consonant,
in Plautus, although in Bacch. 787 we have hasce tabellas (to be scanned
ltasc’ tabellas). We should scan &mit lzose’ de. De quaestoribus, It
was the quaestors whose duty it was to sell sub hasta the booty taken in
war by the Roman army. In the Bacchides v. 1075 the pretended general
on his victorious return laden with spoils says: Nuuc hauc praedam omnem
iam ad quaestorem deferam.

35. Hisce. In early Latin ltisce (spelt properly laeisce), illisce, istisce
were the usual forms of the Nom. Plur. Maso. of the Pronoun augmented
by the Particle -σε, This curicus usage, apparently produced by the
addition of the Plural-suffix -s to the already formed Plurals hi, itti, isti,
is on inscriptions occasionally extended beyond its original limits3 e.g. heis
suut duo concordes on an epitaph, O.I.L. i. 1071, mayz'strez's Germ-us, ‘magistri
Cere1·is,' on a Capua inser. of Sulla's time, O.I.L. i. 566, but not in
literature (unless we admit it in Virg. Eat. iii. 102 His certe, neque amor
causa est, vim ossibus haerent). In Plautus the forms M, illi, isti are found
as a rule when tho next word begins with a consonant3 hisee, illisce, istisce
are never found unless it begins with a vowel. confinxerunt dolum
(cf. 47). Accius has tho same verb, Tray. 639 Β..; amore uecors flammeo,
Depositus facinus pessimum ea· dementia Cortftuy‘zfft (where dqoosz'tus has the
senso of desperatus). Of. Ter. Hec. 693 Coult'uyz's falsas causas ad discordiam ;
Amt. 558 lacrumae confictae dolis.
