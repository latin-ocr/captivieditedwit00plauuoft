Abducite istum actutum ad Hippolytum fabrum,

Iubete huic crassas compedes inpingier;

Inde extra portam ad meum libertum Cordalum 735

In lapicidinas facite deductus siet:

Atque hunc me uelle dicite ita curarier,

Ne qui deterius huic sit quam 6111 pessume est.

precedes a Demonstrative in Plautus (see note on v. 349). Absoluam.
Epid. 466 te absoluam breui, Aul. 517 iam hosce absolutos censeas.

733. Abducite‚ as in vv, 746, 749. 111 v. 721 Geppert proposes to
change ducite of the MSS. into abducite.

734. Huic (cf. vv, 737, 738), but istum in v. 733. At this line Hegio
crosses the stage and stands beside Tyndarus (see note on V. 293). Gom-
pedes “are shackles for the leg (crura, Capt. 6523 suram, Pseud. 1176), of
iron (ferreas, Pers. 573), put on by a smith (Cape. 733, 1027), and worn con-
stantly (Uist. 244), 60 that they [are said to] 6111116 through friction (γράφει
in splendorem compedes, Aul. 602). It is possible to move about and work
in them (Cape. 723 sq., 736, 944), but their weight (ten pounds, Liv. xxxii.
263 fifteen pounds, XII. Tables) effectually prevents escape. They consist
(Allan. 85 f.) of a ring (anias) fastened with a rivet (clavos), and putting them
on is called impinyere (Oapt. 733, Pers. 269, 573). They clank as one walks
(tintinnabant compedes Naevius 114 R. =F est. p. 364 M. ), which shows that
they are connected by a chain. Those who wear them are tintinnabuli uiri
(Truc. 782).” (Α11611 in Harvard Scudz‘es vii. p. 41.)

735. Cordalum. Cordalio is the name of one of tho loo-arii (v. 657).

736. Deductus. We need not hesitate to change diductus of the
MSS, the prefixes de· and di. are so readily confused in MSS. (cf. note on
v. 672).

737. The MSS. put ita after hunc. Perhaps tho word was lost through
Haplog1·aphy(dicite ita) and then set in the margin from which it found its
way into thc wrong part os thc linc.

738. Ne qui, tho reading of B, is on its own account to be preferred to
ne quid, the reading of the other MSS, for qui is appropriate to sentences
with a comparative, cg. Aul. 16 Coepi obseruare ecqui maiorem filius Mihi
