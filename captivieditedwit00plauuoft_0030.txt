one of the two lines being written in red, the other in black, and
Greek letters (‘notae personarum ’) being prefixed to each proper
namel. The same Greek letters were used throughout the Scene to
indicate the speakers. After the first line of the Scene-heading
came the mark Ο, if the Scene was a Canticum, or DV if the Scene
was a Deverbium <Diverbium).

Since A is a palimpsest MS„ anything that was written in red
or other pigment has been washed out, so that all that has been
left of the Scene-headings is the proper names, everything else having
probably been in red pigment. The ‘notae personarum ² throughout
the Scenes have also disappeared, only blank spaces remaining.

In PA most of the Scene-headings seem to have had their
complete equipment of names of persons, names of roleS, ‘notae
personarum,' and the marks C or DV. But the frequent omission
and inaccurate statement of the proper names suggest that in the
original from which PA was itself derived, the proper names were
absent, perhaps never having been filled in by the ‘rubricator.'
Where they are present in ΡΑ, they have been supplied with the
help of the text. Proper names which do not occur in the text
could not be supplied, and so the names of a large number of the
characters in the plays, for which the Scene-headings of A have not
been preserved, remain unknown to us (eg. of the ‘ matrona⁷ in the
Illenaechmi). The same process of supplying missing names to the
Scene-headings was carried on at various stages in the transmission
of the Palatine text.

The Scene-heading nomenclature in our minuscule MSS. has
therefore no authority. Their curious s'rALITlO (·CIO) of Cas. 11. iii.,
111. iii, for which we find in A (at 111. iii.) the right name,
LYSIDAMUS, has been absurdly extr-acted from two corrupt readings
of the Palatine text, tibi stalmo for te'ttibilicio in v. 347 z

non ego istuc uerbum empsim tittibilicio,
and stalicio for sta ilico in v, 960 :

licus, sta ilico, amator.

¹ This was tho normal sorni. But wc have occasional departures from it,
eg. I’oen. v. v. (1<)AN'1‘A1x=10151N11›Es EIDEM (·C·). (Seyffert in Bursian’s
