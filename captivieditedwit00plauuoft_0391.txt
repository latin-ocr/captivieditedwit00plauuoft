(2) the complete avoidance of a metrical ictus like yeneno, pectoribus in
tribrach—words and word-endings, and the almost complete avoidancel of
the same in dactyl-words and word-endings‚ eg. pecata, disperdere. These
laws, imposed on the Greek Dramatic Metres as soon as they were trans-
planted to Roman soil, reveal unmistakably the existence of an accentuaL
beside the quantitative clement, in early Latin dramatic poetry2. To what
extent does this accentual element assert itself?

6. As regards the accentuation os the single word (word-accent as
opposed to sentence—accent) we find a wonderful amount of agreement
between ictus and accent in the lines of Plautus. His greatest difficulty
must, of course, have been with iambus-words like fero, ferunt, and it must
have been increased by the large number of long final syllables in the
language at his time, eg. feror, ferat (see Intr. ii. ξ 1). The Latin Accent,
as we have seen (ξ 1), is excluded from the final syllable, so that the word-
accent was fe'ro, ferunt, feror, fe'rat. But the nature of the Iambic and
Trochaic metres allows no opportunity for the ictus to fall on a short
syllable immediately followed by a long syllable. The permissible ictus-
forms in an Iambic line are (1) Iambus «Δ, (2) Spondee —‡‚ (3) Tribrach
νύν, (4) Anapaest *νή (5) Dactyl -ύν, (6) Proceleusmatic »Νίκη in a
Trochaic (1) Trochee έν, (2) Spondee ‡—‚ (3) Tribrach Φνν, (4) Anapaest

1 Pactam διο. may be used in the first foot of an iambic (bacchiac, eg. Cisc.
686, dcc.) line or hemistich, and (with disperdere dcc.) in any part of an anapaestic
line.

² Ritschl's dictum on the verse of the Latin Dramatists (Proleyq. ch. xv.):
cum quantitatis severitate summam accentus observationem, quoad eius fieri
posset, conciliatam esse, has never been successfully impugned. Prof. W.
Meyer, in a long article in the Proeeediuys of the Bavaricm Academy for 1884,
has stated perhaps as powerful a case as can be stated against it. His main
argument is that such coincidence as there is of accent and ictus in Plautus is
really due to the law of Latin Accentuatffin, which requires every long penulti-
mate syllable to be accented; the metrical ictus falls normally on long syllables
in the line, and where these long syllables happen to be penultimate syllables,
the ictus must coincide with the accent. There are thus, he says, more chauces
of the ictus and accent lighting on the same syllable in Latin than in Greek
poetry, and this, and this only, is the reason of the coincidences to which
Bitschl has drawn attention in Plautus. Then he proceeds to make a minute
investigation into the technique of I’lautus‘ versification, especially his treat—
ment of the trochaic and iambic caesura, with the object of shewing that the
avoidance of this and that form of caesura would compel the choice at certain
parts of the line of such words as would necessarily have the ictus on the same
syllable as the acoent. These details of technique have been challenged by
Prof. Langen in the philologum, vol. xlvi„ who also supplies us with a striking
refutation of Meyer’s main argument. He himself, he tells us, once made the
experiment of applying the Latin accentual laws to the trimeters of Aristophanes,
but found that the coincidence of accent and ictus was not at all so frequent as
it is in the Senarii of Plautus and Terence, a fact which plainly indicates some
other influence to be at work in the latter.
